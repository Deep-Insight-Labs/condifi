  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The market is driven by the urgency to decarbonize and the emergence of powerful policy incentives. Over 1,400 new hydrogen production projects were announced worldwide from 2020 to 2023, with Europe accounting for over half of the world's announced renewable hydrogen projects.\n\nThe market's versatility is recognized for its potential to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors like steel, chemicals, and heavy-duty trucking. Approximately 100 million tons of hydrogen will be necessary by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement's climate objectives, and by 2050, that figure is expected to jump to 500 million tons.\n\nKey drivers of the market include accelerating policy support, falling renewables reducing green hydrogen costs, and rising demand for decarbonized feedstock. Top trends include growing cross-border hydrogen trade, electrolyzer technology innovations reducing capital costs, and industries integrating blended hydrogen systems for heating, power, and transport.\n\nHowever, the market faces challenges such as high production costs, policy uncertainties, limited renewable energy availability, underdeveloped storage and transport systems, and a shortfall of supportive infrastructure. To overcome these challenges, a more favorable landscape is required, with stronger carbon pricing, standardized regulations, and a global system for hydrogen trade.\n\nThe economic potential of the clean hydrogen market is staggering, with projections indicating that by 2050, the market could be worth up to US$1.4 trillion. Emerging economies stand to benefit significantly, with up to 70% of this multi-trillion-dollar opportunity flowing to developing nations. Hydrogen-related activities could support the creation of 2 million jobs per year from 2030 to 2050.\n\nTo realize hydrogen's transformative potential, massive investment is required, with experts confirming that upwards of US$9 trillion will be needed globally to ensure the clean hydrogen supply chain can meet net-zero targets by 2050. The price gap between green hydrogen and natural gas-based blue hydrogen remains a barrier to full market dominance.\n\nTop companies in the hydrogen market include Air Liquide International S.A., Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Atawey, Claind, Cummins, Ergousp, Enapter AG, EvolOH, Inc., Fuel Cell Energy, Green Hydrogen Systems, Heliogen, Accelera (Cummins), HyTech Power, Inox, ITM Power, Linde plc, McPhy Energy, Messer Group GmbH, NEL Hydrogen, Plug Power, PowerTap, Siemens AG, Showa Denko, Starfire Energy, Taiyo Nippon, and Verdagy.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
