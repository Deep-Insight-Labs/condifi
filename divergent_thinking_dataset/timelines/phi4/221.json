Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The week ahead is expected to be busy with the release of core PCE price index and a slate of Fed speakers, including district governors Tom Barkin, Raphael Bostic, Patrick Harker, and Michelle Bowman.\n\nNvidia's Q4 earnings report is expected to be a key update, with analysts forecasting earnings of $0.85 per share, a 67% increase from the year-ago period, and revenue of $38.1 billion, a 72% annual surge. The company's dominance in the AI chip market and strong guidance position it as a clear buy.\n\nLowe's, on the other hand, is set for a challenging week ahead, with muted market expectations and a cautious outlook for the current quarter. The company's struggles with near-term profitability and market headwinds suggest that its stock may be best avoided for now. Lowe's has a below-average InvestingPro Financial Health Score of 2.4 out of 5.0, reflecting concerns about weak revenue performance and slowing growth prospects.\n\nNvidia has a market cap of $3.31 trillion, making it the second most valuable company trading on the U.S. stock exchange after Apple. The company's shares are up 0.1% in 2025, and its InvestingPro Financial Health Score is 3.62, reflecting its robust operational performance and market leadership.\n\nLowe's has a market cap of $135 billion and is trading below its key moving averages. The company's shares are down 3.1% to start the new year, and its InvestingPro Fair Value analysis suggests the stock may be overvalued, with a -20.0% downside from its current price to a calculated fair value of $191.30.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
