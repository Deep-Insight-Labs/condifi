  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The artificial intelligence (AI) growth story is in its early days, and the Federal Reserve has launched interest rate cuts, which could support stock performance in the year ahead. \n\nSome stocks could stand out in 2025 and over the long term, offering a combination of growth and security. Here are the top 10 buys:\n\n1. Eli Lilly (LLY) - maker of weight loss drugs tirzepatide and Mounjaro, which have become blockbusters, bringing in billions of dollars in revenue. The obesity drug market may reach $130 billion by 2030, and Lilly is well positioned to benefit from this growth.\n\n2. Meta Platforms (META) - a leader in social media, generating billions of dollars in advertising revenue. The company is investing heavily in AI, which could generate other compelling products and services over time.\n\n3. Salesforce (CRM) - a leader in customer relationship management software, with a new growth opportunity in agentic AI. The company has already signed 200 deals, and the pipeline for future deals looks strong.\n\n4. Chewy (CHWY) - an e-commerce platform for pet owners, with a strong financial health, being debt-free and having a liquidity position of about $1.3 billion. The company has recently launched veterinary clinics to expand its business opportunity.\n\n5. CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) - a gene-editing technology company that has won its first regulatory approval for a product based on its technology. The company is working on several other candidates, which could be just the beginning of its growth story.\n\n6. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) - the global leader in robotic surgery, with a solid moat and a competitive advantage. The company generates more quarterly revenue from the sales of instruments and accessories than from sales of the robots themselves.\n\n7. CrowdStrike (CRWD) - a leader in cybersecurity, with a strong pipeline of deals and a loyal customer base. The company has recently experienced a major outage, but has quickly tackled the problem and offered compensation packages to customers.\n\n8. Amazon (AMZN) - a leader in e-commerce and cloud computing, with a strong cost structure and a focus on AI. The company may become one of the biggest winners of the AI boom.\n\n9. Nvidia (NVDA) - a chip designer and a leader in AI, with a wide range of related products and services. The company has generated double- and triple-digit revenue quarter after quarter, and has a gross margin of more than 70%.\n\n10. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) - an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500, offering exposure to the top players driving the day's economy. The ETF has an expense ratio of 0.09%, making it inexpensive and well worth the investment.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
