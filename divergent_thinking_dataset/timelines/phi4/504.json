Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The company has a massive backlog of expansion projects, with $20 billion in secured projects and $34.5 billion in combined new growth opportunities through 2030. Key projects include:\n\n- Mainline capital investment: up to $1.4 billion through 2028 to improve pipeline reliability and efficiency\n- Birch Grove: $276 million expansion of the T-North Pipeline to move additional natural gas supplies\n- T15 expansion: $69 million expansion to double the capacity of the gas utility expansion project in support of Duke Energy's Roxboro gas-fired power plant\n\nEnbridge expects to deliver 7-9% growth in adjusted EBITDA through 2026 and 5% annually after that, with 3-5% annual distributable cash flow-per-share growth. This growth supports annual dividend increases of up to 3% through next year, potentially accelerating to 5% after 2026. The company sees opportunities to expand each of its franchises, with the biggest growth potential in gas transmission.\n\nEnbridge's diversified infrastructure footprint is positioned to meet growing global energy demand, with a balance of oil, natural gas, and renewable power across five countries, 43 states, and eight provinces. The company is pursuing expansion projects in liquids pipelines, gas distribution and storage, and renewable power, with a focus on lower-carbon opportunities.\n\nThe combination of Enbridge's high dividend yield and solid growth prospects positions it to produce strong total returns for investors, potentially achieving 10-12% annual returns when adding in its high-yielding and steadily rising dividend.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
