Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The company delivered 1.79 million vehicles, missing Wall Street consensus estimates. Tesla shares tumbled 6% following the announcement. \n\nFourth quarter deliveries fell short of expectations, with 496,000 vehicles delivered, a 7% sequential increase and a 2% year-over-year rise. Production numbers were also underwhelming, with 459,000 vehicles produced in the fourth quarter, a 2% decline quarter-over-quarter and a 7% drop year-over-year.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst lowered 2025 delivery estimates to 2.01 million vehicles, down from 2.03 million, implying a 12% year-over-year growth, short of Tesla's 20%-30% annual growth target. The firm also lowered 2024 earnings-per-share estimate from $2.01 to $2 and its 2025 EPS estimate from $2.85 to $2.80.\n\nGoldman Sachs maintains its 2026 delivery forecast of 2.3 million units, offsetting slightly lower expectations for premium models with higher growth assumptions for more affordable models. The firm reiterated its 12-month price target of $345 for Tesla stock, holding a Neutral rating, highlighting fundamental challenges to the core auto business but recognizing potential for stronger long-term growth driven by software and services.\n\nTesla continues to make strides in its Full Self-Driving software, with version 13 rolled out to customers in late 2024, improving miles to critical intervention. Goldman Sachs suggests Tesla could launch a limited robotaxi service in the next 12-24 months using remote assistance.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
