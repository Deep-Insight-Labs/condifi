{"Scenario":{"0":"Intel enters 2025 without a permanent CEO and with a strategy somewhat up in the air. The company's multiyear turnaround effort has yet to pay off as it struggles in the PC and data center markets. Intel's foundry business, a key component of its turnaround plan, hinges on the success of its Intel 18A process node, which is expected to be ready for production in early 2025. The company has snagged a few big-name customers, including Microsoft and Amazon, but it's unclear when those deals will begin to produce meaningful external foundry revenue.\n\nIntel plans to reach $15 billion in annual external foundry revenue by 2030, but any delays or missteps with Intel 18A could be catastrophic for the company. Intel is also launching new PC and server CPUs in 2025, including Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest, which will use the Intel 18A process. The company's product roadmap is dependent on the success of Intel 18A, and a delay or issue could impact its competitiveness in the PC and server markets.\n\nIntel's stock has cratered in response to the uncertainty and upheaval plaguing the company, but it trades well below book value, indicating the market is extremely pessimistic. The company's position as the only U.S.-based advanced logic semiconductor manufacturer puts it in a unique position, and with the right leader and strategy, Intel stock could end up being a big winner over the next decade.","1":"The modular data centers market is expected to grow by USD 42.56 billion during 2023-2028, with a CAGR of 19.8%.

Intel enters 2025 without a permanent CEO and with a strategy somewhat up in the air. The company's multiyear turnaround effort has yet to pay off as it struggles in the PC and data center markets. Intel's foundry business, a key component of its turnaround plan, hinges on the success of its Intel 18A process node, which is expected to be ready for production in early 2025. The company has snagged a few big-name customers, including Microsoft and Amazon, but it's unclear when those deals will begin to produce meaningful external foundry revenue.\n\nIntel plans to reach $15 billion in annual external foundry revenue by 2030, but any delays or missteps with Intel 18A could be catastrophic for the company. Intel is also launching new PC and server CPUs in 2025, including Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest, which will use the Intel 18A process. The company's product roadmap is dependent on the success of Intel 18A, and a delay or issue could impact its competitiveness in the PC and server markets.\n\nIntel's stock has cratered in response to the uncertainty and upheaval plaguing the company, but it trades well below book value, indicating the market is extremely pessimistic. The company's position as the only U.S.-based advanced logic semiconductor manufacturer puts it in a unique position, and with the right leader and strategy, Intel stock could end up being a big winner over the next decade.","1":"[TIMEOUT] Scenario: The modular data centers market is expected to grow by USD 42.56 billion during 2023-2028, with a CAGR of 19.8%.
