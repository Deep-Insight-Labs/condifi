  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The company's transformational year was marked by its foray into live sporting events, including a boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, which reached an estimated 108 million live viewers worldwide, and NFL games on Christmas Day, which reached an average of 24 million viewers. Netflix's live events have been record-setting broadcasts, with shares of the company experiencing pronounced momentum around the times of these events.\n\nNetflix's live events strategy is different from other streamers, such as Amazon and Apple, which also offer live sports. The company's ability to strike partnerships across sports and entertainment could become a significant opportunity for growth. The upcoming WWE Raw campaign on January 6 may be another tailwind for Netflix, potentially leading to increased investor interest in the stock.\n\nKey financial information:\n\n- Netflix stock gained 85% in 2024\n- Shares of Netflix popped as high as 14% following the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson match\n- Netflix stock has gained a net of 10% through December 30\n- Shares of Netflix dropped by roughly 3% following the Christmas Day NFL games\n\nEconomic and political information:\n\n- The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 24% and 30%, respectively, in 2024\n- The macroeconomic picture has been steadily improving\n- Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockbuster weight loss drugs have been tailwinds for the market\n\nRelevant information for professional investors:\n\n- Netflix's live events strategy may be a significant opportunity for growth\n- The company's ability to strike partnerships across sports and entertainment could lead to increased investor interest\n- The upcoming WWE Raw campaign on January 6 may be another tailwind for Netflix\n- Netflix's stock has experienced pronounced momentum around the times of its live events.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
