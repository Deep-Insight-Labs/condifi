  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

Historically, investing in the S&P 500 on days when it hits a new all-time high results in slightly above-average returns in the subsequent 12 months. However, the S&P 500's big run-up has left many stocks trading at sky-high valuations, with the average stock trading at 24.7 times trailing earnings.\n\nWarren Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, has been selling stocks aggressively, with a 23% drop in the total value of stocks it owns to $271.7 billion in the first nine months of 2024. Buffett has sold significant stakes in Apple, Snowflake, Paramount Global, and HP, and has exited more than two-thirds of his stake in Apple. This has led investors to assume that Buffett can't find attractively priced stocks now.\n\nHowever, Buffett's actions suggest that he is preparing for a bear market. He has been hoarding cash, with a 96% increase in Berkshire Hathaway's cash and short-term Treasury Bills to $320.3 billion. Buffett has also been buying stocks, including new stakes in Chubb Limited, Domino's Pizza, and Pool Corp.\n\nThe Buffett Indicator, which measures the ratio of US stock market capitalization to GDP, is currently at 205%, a historically high level that suggests a bear market is around the corner. Buffett's performance has been driven by his ability to buy stocks at low prices during market downturns, and his current cash hoard suggests that he is ready to pounce during the next bear market.\n\nKey financial and economic information:\n\n- S&P 500 index increase: 53% from the end of 2022 to the end of 2024\n- Average stock valuation: 24.7 times trailing earnings\n- Buffett Indicator: 205%, a historically high level\n- Berkshire Hathaway's cash and short-term Treasury Bills: $320.3 billion\n- Berkshire Hathaway's total value of stocks owned: $271.7 billion\n\nRelevant information for a professional investor:\n\n- Historically, investing in the S&P 500 on days when it hits a new all-time high results in slightly above-average returns in the subsequent 12 months\n- Buffett's actions suggest that he is preparing for a bear market\n- The Buffett Indicator is a historically high level that suggests a bear market is around the corner\n- Buffett's performance has been driven by his ability to buy stocks at low prices during market downturns.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
