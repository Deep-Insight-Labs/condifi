  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The agreement involves the construction of a nine-megawatt alkaline electrolyzer plant on Jurong Island, Singapore, to produce green hydrogen. This move is part of Linde's efforts to expand its presence in the growing hydrogen market.\n\nThe global hydrogen market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.63% over the projected period of 2024-2029, driven by increasing demand for hydrogen-based fuels, growing focus on industrial decarbonization, and ongoing developments in steel and power generation industries. The global hydrogen market value stood at US$216.19 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach US$346.19 billion by 2029.\n\nThe global hydrogen market demand is projected to increase to 138.81 million metric tons by 2030, driven by commitments by major economies to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, declining costs of renewable energy sources, and emerging applications of hydrogen in sectors like steel manufacturing. The market is expected to be driven by the increasing adoption of hydrogen fuel cells, growing use of green hydrogen, and rising focus on achieving net-zero emissions targets.\n\nThe global hydrogen market is mildly consolidated, with the top players acquiring a majority of the market share. Key players in the market include Linde, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Nel ASA, FuelCell Energy, Inc., and Iwatani Corporation. The market is expected to see an increase in the number of initiatives by both developed and developing countries to generate green hydrogen, augmenting the growth of the global hydrogen market.\n\nLinde's agreement with Evonik is a significant development in the company's efforts to expand its presence in the growing hydrogen market. The agreement demonstrates Linde's commitment to supplying green hydrogen to meet the increasing demand for clean energy. The global hydrogen market is expected to continue growing, driven by increasing demand for hydrogen-based fuels, growing focus on industrial decarbonization, and ongoing developments in steel and power generation industries.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
