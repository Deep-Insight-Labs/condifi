  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

He argues that the AI rally will be a multiyear event, similar to the dot-com boom of the 1990s. Ives points to rapid growth in stocks like Nvidia, Micron, and software companies, as well as macro trends such as a friendlier regulatory environment under President Trump and anticipated support for AI initiatives from the new administration.\n\nHowever, investors should be cautious due to high valuations, with the Nasdaq up over 50% in the past two years and trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 35. Stocks like Apple are particularly inflated, with a P/E ratio of 41 and a market cap approaching $4 trillion. A better strategy for investors is to tactfully invest in the industry, waiting for pullbacks in specific stocks or buying ETFs to diversify risk.\n\nKey financial information:\n\n- Nvidia has reported rapid growth\n- Micron is joining the AI rally\n- Software companies are also participating in the AI boom\n- The Nasdaq is up over 50% in the past two years\n- The Nasdaq is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 35\n- Apple trades at a P/E ratio of 41\n- Apple's market cap is approaching $4 trillion\n\nKey economic and political information:\n\n- The AI boom is expected to drive a multiyear rally in the stock market\n- A friendlier regulatory environment under President Trump is expected to benefit big business\n- The new administration is anticipated to support AI initiatives\n- Lina Khan's stepping down as head of the Federal Trade Commission is expected to lead to a more favorable regulatory environment\n\nRelevant information for professional investors:\n\n- Investors should be cautious of high valuations in the tech sector\n- A better strategy for investors is to tactfully invest in the industry, waiting for pullbacks in specific stocks or buying ETFs to diversify risk\n- The AI boom still has the ability to carry the tech sector higher over the next few years, but there will likely be pullbacks as the market wrestles with higher prices for the biggest tech stocks.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
