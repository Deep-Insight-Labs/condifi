Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The new regulation aims to deny China's access to advanced semiconductor technology used in AI chip development and manufacturing. The rule will have a 120-day comment period, but a bipartisan consensus suggests it may be difficult to change.\n\nThe new framework allows bulk AI chip orders with a cumulative compute power equivalent to up to 1,700 high-end GPUs to be unaffected. Enterprises within the exempt nations can opt for National Verified End User (NVEU) status, granting up to 320,000 GPUs worth of compute power over two years. Entities outside the framework can buy up to 50,000 GPUs worth of compute power, which can be doubled with a direct government-to-government agreement.\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) have expressed concerns that the rule will cause unintended and lasting damage to America's economy and global competitiveness. Oracle's executive vice president, Ken Glueck, has also criticized the new framework, calling it \"one of the most destructive ever to hit the U.S. technology industry.\"\n\nThe new regulation may disrupt global supply chains and existing AI infrastructure rollout plans, particularly for companies like Nvidia, which has a large customer base in the US. Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's AWS rollout outside the US may be curtailed to half of their AI compute capacity, while non-trusted countries will be limited to 7% of their compute power.\n\nThe incoming Trump administration may cut some of the regulatory morass, but it remains to be seen whether the national security faction will gain more ground over the technocratic faction. The new framework may have unintended consequences, including limiting US companies' global market share and encouraging China to accelerate its own technological advancements.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
