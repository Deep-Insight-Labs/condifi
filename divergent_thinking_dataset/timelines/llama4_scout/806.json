  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The company reported $23.7 billion in sales and $5.9 billion in profits last year. It owns Booking.com, Kayak.com, and Priceline.com and has a market value of around $150 billion. Despite near-term economic challenges, it is considered a good buy for long-term growth in the travel industry.\n\nApple, the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of $3.3 trillion, would have turned a $1,000 investment into approximately $151,000 over 20 years. Its revenue growth has been modest, but its services business generated 14% revenue growth last quarter and now accounts for over one-fifth of the company's total revenue. Apple has generated more than $98 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months and is considered a dependable investment.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals would have turned a $1,000 investment into approximately $125,000 over 20 years. The company has generated more than $14.2 billion in sales and $4.4 billion in net income. It has a strong pipeline of potential drug candidates and is considered a good buy and hold stock, trading at 14 times its estimated future earnings.\n[Output in JSON]\n",

explores the potential impact of economic uncertainty on the travel, tech, and biotech sectors, specifically focusing on Booking Holdings, Apple, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. The scenario branches into different paths based on possible responses to economic slowdown, geopolitical escalation, and sector-specific developments.\n\n**Plausibility:** The timeline is grounded in current macroeconomic data, institutional knowledge, and historical analogs. Each path is supported by logical cause-effect relationships and timing.\n\n**Novelty:** The timeline demonstrates creative reasoning by identifying counterintuitive paths, rare risks, and hidden feedback loops. For example, the possibility of Booking Holdings' underperforming brands repositioning and restructuring, or Apple's accelerated supply chain diversification.\n\n**Elaboration:** The timeline provides specific and refined occurrences, with each node standing alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity.\n\n**Actionable:** The timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, and opportunities for investment actions or hedging strategies. For instance, investors may consider long positions in Apple or Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, or short positions in Booking Holdings' underperforming brands.\n\nThe output provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the potential scenarios, allowing for informed investment decisions and risk management strategies.",
