  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The company's operating earnings per share (EPS) stood at $0.58, a 100% increase from the $0.29 EPS reported in the same quarter of 2023. This exceeded analyst consensus estimates of $0.54 EPS. Revenue for the quarter reached $3.4 billion, falling short of the forecasted $3.86 billion and analyst estimates of approximately $3.94 billion.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to Dominion Energy's improved EPS, including commercial load growth and reduced interest expenses. Commercial load growth signifies an increase in electricity demand from business customers, potentially reflecting stronger economic activity within Dominion Energy's service territories. Lower interest expenses positively impact profitability by reducing the cost of debt financing for the company.\n\nThe Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project is a flagship endeavor among Dominion Energy's renewable energy initiatives. The project has reached a significant milestone, achieving approximately 50% completion and remaining on track for full operation by the end of 2026. The estimated total cost for CVOW has been updated to $10.7 billion, primarily attributed to higher network upgrade costs assigned by PJM to ensure grid reliability and effective integration of the new power generation.\n\nCVOW is projected to generate enough clean energy to power approximately 660,000 homes, create around 2,000 direct and indirect American jobs, and stimulate $2 billion in economic activity. The project is strategically positioned to supply clean energy to the growing data center market in Virginia, the largest such market globally.\n\nDominion Energy is strategically shifting towards a broader portfolio of cleaner energy sources, including offshore wind, solar power, battery storage, nuclear energy, and to ensure grid reliability. The company is actively investing in expanding its renewable energy capacity, with substantial planned solar power and battery storage additions in the coming years.\n\nData centers are a significant driver of electricity demand, particularly in Northern Virginia, where Dominion Energy is a primary energy provider. Data center electricity sales now constitute approximately 26% of Dominion Energy Virginia's total sales. The growth in data center demand is unprecedented, driving a substantial increase in Dominion Energy's contracted capacity.\n\nTo meet this rapidly growing demand, Dominion Energy is making significant investments in its transmission infrastructure, including new 500 kV transmission lines, to ensure reliable power delivery to data centers and other customers. The immense energy consumption of data centers reinforces the economic viability and necessity of Dominion Energy's renewable energy investments.\n\nDominion Energy's Q4 2024 earnings report provides a clear signal that its investments in renewable energy are beginning to translate into tangible financial results. The company's strategic embrace of an \"all-of-the-above\" energy strategy, with a growing emphasis on renewables like offshore wind and solar, positions it favorably in the evolving energy landscape.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
