Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

SPGI shares are trading higher in the premarket session on Tuesday. The company reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.77, beating the street view of $3.48. Quarterly sales of $3.592 billion (+14%) outpaced the analyst consensus estimate of $3.503 billion, driven by growth in all divisions. Revenue from subscription products increased 6%.\n\nAdjusted operating profit margin increased 260 basis points to 46.7%, primarily due to strength in the Ratings unit. The company exited the quarter with cash and equivalents worth $1.66 billion and long-term debt of $11.394 billion.\n\nS&P Global recently authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.96, marking the company's 52nd consecutive year of dividend increases. The Board has also authorized the repurchase of shares totaling up to $4.3 billion, with an initial $650 million Accelerated Share Repurchase to be launched in the coming weeks.\n\nFor the full year 2025, S&P Global maintains its target of returning 85% or more of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company projects FY25 revenue growth of 5% – 7%, along with adjusted EPS in the range of $17.00 to $17.25, above the $16.92 estimate.\n\nS&P Global expects 2025 cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders, of ~$5.9 billion. It expects adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, of $6 billion.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
