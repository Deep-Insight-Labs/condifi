  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The market is driven by the sheer volume of data generated daily, with healthcare data volume expected to approach 10,000 exabytes by 2025. The average hospital can generate as much as 50 petabytes of data per year, and over 100 million patient records remain underutilized annually across large hospital networks.\n\nKey players in the market include Oracle Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Google, Salesforce, Inc., SAS Institute Inc., SAP SE, TIBCO Software Inc., Sisense Inc., McKesson Corporation, Siemens AG, Accenture Plc, GE Healthcare, and Infosys Limited. The market is segmented by type, deployment, technology, data type, facility size, application, end-user, and region.\n\nThe market is expected to grow due to the increasing adoption of wearable health devices, connected medical devices, and telemedicine. The number of wearable health devices is forecasted to exceed 1 billion by 2025, and the global count of connected medical devices is anticipated to surpass 50 billion in the same timeframe.\n\nThe market is also driven by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and advanced analytics. The Healthcare Data Monetization Solutions market is uniquely poised for massive growth, with industry stakeholders strategizing to meet demand for interoperable platforms and sophisticated analytics tools.\n\nHowever, the market faces significant operational hurdles, including staggering volumes of unstructured data that require specialized processing pipelines. The average global hospital spends over US$1.5 million each year to enhance its data analytics and cybersecurity posture, and compliance requirements drive these expenditures ever upward.\n\nThe market is expected to benefit from diverse applications and industries, including IoT-based implants in cardiology, pharmaceuticals sector, and medical insurers and payers. The market is also expected to be driven by strategic roadmaps and future innovations, including precision diagnostics and personalized therapeutics, blockchain-based ledgers, quantum computing breakthroughs, and federated learning models.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
