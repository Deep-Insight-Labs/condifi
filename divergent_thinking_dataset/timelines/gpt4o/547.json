Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

According to estimates, AI technology's electricity consumption could increase from 8 terawatt-hours in 2024 to 652 terawatt-hours by 2030. Nuclear power could help solve this challenge as it is efficient and clean. \n\nThree top nuclear stocks to consider are: \n\n1. Cameco, a leading uranium producer with a 18% global uranium supply share, poised for long-term growth as big technology companies and countries consider nuclear power to meet energy needs while reducing carbon emissions. Analysts estimate the company's revenue will hit $2.3 billion in 2025. Cameco's business has picked up over the past couple of years.\n\n2. Southern Company, one of the largest energy companies in the US, with a core business in electricity generation and electric and natural gas utilities serving over 9 million customers. The company has invested heavily in nuclear energy and offers a 3.5% dividend yield. It's not the cheapest utility, but it's not unbearable for long-term investors.\n\n3. GE Vernova, a diversified clean energy technology company that deals in clean power generation, grid electrification, and wind and gas turbines. Its power generation business includes nuclear, providing reactors, fuel, services, and steam turbines for electricity generation. Management anticipates high single-digit revenue growth through 2028 and is investing $5 billion cumulatively in research and development to drive long-term growth.\n\nThe companies are exposed to the growth in nuclear energy, which is expected to increase by 2.5 times its current capacity by 2050. Geopolitical tensions, including the US ban on uranium imports from Russia, could further boost business for Western producers like Cameco.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
