  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The probe will examine the company's Medicare Advantage plans and physician groups following reports of questionable diagnoses. UnitedHealth received billions in federal payments for these diagnoses, some of which were irrelevant or undocumented.\n\nA Wall Street Journal analysis found that UnitedHealth-employed doctors significantly increased lucrative diagnoses for patients in the company's Medicare Advantage plans. The analysis also found that some diagnoses were added without physician treatment, resulting in an extra $8.7 billion in federal payments in 2021.\n\nUnitedHealth has defended its Medicare billing practices, arguing that they lead to more accurate diagnoses, improve patient care, and reduce healthcare costs. However, the company has faced ongoing criticism over its claim denial practices, with a Senate investigation concluding that Medicare Advantage providers, including UnitedHealthcare, intentionally denied claims to increase profits.\n\nUnitedHealthcare is offering some employees in its benefits operations unit a chance to take a buyout if they resign by March 3. Investor Bill Ackman has expressed concerns about the company's practices, stating that when a company attacks its critics, the probability of committing fraud increases substantially.\n\nUnitedHealth Group's stock price was down 10.2% at $451.36 during the premarket session. The company is already under scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission over price markups on specialty generic drugs.\n\nKey financial information:\n\n- UnitedHealth Group received billions in federal payments for questionable diagnoses.\n- The company's Medicare Advantage plans and physician groups are under investigation.\n- UnitedHealth Group's stock price was down 10.2% at $451.36 during the premarket session.\n\nKey economic information:\n\n- The investigation will examine the company's Medicare billing practices and potential impact on federal payments.\n- The company's claim denial practices have been criticized, with a Senate investigation concluding that Medicare Advantage providers intentionally denied claims to increase profits.\n\nKey political information:\n\n- The Justice Department has launched a civil fraud investigation into UnitedHealth Group's Medicare billing practices.\n- The Federal Trade Commission is also scrutinizing the company over price markups on specialty generic drugs.\n\nRelevant information for professional investors:\n\n- The company's stock price was down 10.2% at $451.36 during the premarket session.\n- Investor Bill Ackman has expressed concerns about the company's practices, stating that when a company attacks its critics, the probability of committing fraud increases substantially.\n- The company is already under scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
