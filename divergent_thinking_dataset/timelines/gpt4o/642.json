  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

This growth is attributed to the rising global prevalence of various malignancies, increased research and development (R&D) activities, heightened investment and funding, the approval of new immunotoxin therapies, and an increase in collaborations and partnerships.\n\nBy product, the Diphtheria Toxin (DT) segment emerged as the highest revenue-generating segment in the global immunotoxins market in 2023, due to the proven effectiveness of DT-based immunotoxins in targeted cancer therapies. The Pseudomonas Exotoxin segment is anticipated to witness the fastest CAGR during the forecast period, driven by the success of Pseudomonas exotoxin-based therapies in clinical trials and advancements that enhance tumor-targeting capabilities while reducing immunogenicity.\n\nBy application, the therapy development segment accounted for the highest revenue in the global immunotoxins market in 2023, resulting from an increased focus on creating novel immunotoxin-based therapies. The biomedical research segment is projected to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period, spurred by escalating interest in exploring immunotoxins for new therapeutic applications.\n\nBy end-user, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies segment represented the highest revenue-generating segment in the global immunotoxins market in 2023, attributed to robust R&D efforts, strong product pipelines, strategic partnerships, and the growing commercialization of innovative immunotoxin-based therapies. The academic and research institutes segment is expected to exhibit the fastest CAGR during the forecast period, driven by increased emphasis on fundamental research, heightened collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, access to government and private research funding, and advancements in the early-stage development of new immunotoxin therapies.\n\nNorth America is anticipated to have the highest revenue share during the forecast period owing to the presence of major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, advanced healthcare infrastructure, high investment in cancer research, and early adoption of innovative immunotoxin therapies. The Asia Pacific region is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the rising prevalence of cancer, increasing healthcare expenditure, growing biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, expanding clinical trial activities, and improvements in healthcare infrastructure in countries such as China and India.\n\nKey players in the immunotoxins market include Amgen Inc., Eisai Co. Ltd., Genentech (Roche), AbbVie Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Novartis AG, Merck & Co.
