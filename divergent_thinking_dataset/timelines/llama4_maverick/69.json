  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

They share their experiences and advice for getting started with investing. \n\nAlicia Alfiere started investing in high school with the help of her father, who was initially hesitant but eventually agreed to invest in a mutual fund. She recommends reading widely and seeking out diverse perspectives to increase knowledge and understanding of investing.\n\nBill Barker suggests that investors learn from the greats, particularly Warren Buffett, and recommends reading his letters to shareholders and articles. He also advises starting with index funds and diversifying investments.\n\nDavid Meier emphasizes the importance of patience and holding onto investments for the long term, citing his own experience of selling Meta too soon and missing out on gains. He recommends writing down the purpose of buying a stock and returning to that thesis when considering selling.\n\nRicky Mulvey shares his experience of investing in InvenSense, a company that was eventually overtaken by competition. He advises investors to be aware of the competitive advantage of a company and to diversify beyond what's gone up in the recent past.\n\nThe analysts also discuss the importance of community and seeking out mentors, as well as the value of journaling and understanding the emotional aspects of investing. They recommend having a holding period of 5-10 years and not being swayed by short-term market fluctuations.\n\nThe article concludes with a message of encouragement for new investors, urging them to start slow, build their community, and stay within their circle of competence. It also promotes the Motley Fool's flagship investing service, Stock Advisor, and invites listeners to learn more about the service.\n[Output in JSON]\n",

In the case of market volatility, investors who stay the course can achieve long-term success.\n*   The second branch (T1A2) represents investors focusing on individual stocks, which can result in successful stock picks or poor stock picks. Investors who make poor stock picks can learn from their mistakes and adjust their strategies, ultimately achieving long-term success.\n*   The third branch (T1A3) represents investors seeking community and mentorship, which can lead to improved investing decisions and increased confidence. With community support, investors can achieve long-term investing success.\n\nThe timeline is plausible, as it is based on the advice and insights shared by experienced investors. It is also novel, as it explores different possible outcomes based on the analysts' recommendations. The elaboration is high, as each node provides specific details on the possible outcomes. Finally, the timeline is actionable, as it provides insights that can inform investment decisions and strategies.",
