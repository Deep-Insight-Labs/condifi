  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The top 5 performers in the S&P 500 were Palantir, Vistra, NVIDIA, United Airlines, and Axon Enterprise. These companies had in common a focus on generative AI and its applications. Vistra, a small energy company in Texas, specializes in clean energy and nuclear energy, which is a hot play for those interested in nuclear reactors at data centers. United Airlines' success can be attributed to its investments in its fleet, hub configuration, and new markets internationally, as well as the airline industry's tailwinds. Axon Enterprise's success is due to its improvement in safety and its AI bent.\n\nInvestors are looking for opportunities where generative AI or its requirements juice companies' earnings over the long term. The market is also seeing a trend of underappreciated companies, like United Airlines, gaining attention. The weight loss drug space, which was a major growth area in 2022 and 2023, has slowed down, with companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk experiencing a decline in stock price.\n\nThe year also saw a return to assets by investors, with gold and Bitcoin experiencing significant gains. This can be attributed to concerns about fiat money and the federal deficit, which has doubled since the pre-pandemic era. The US market has become the only game in town, attracting more and more money from other markets.\n\nOn the losing side, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Intel, Moderna, Celanese, and Dollar Tree experienced significant declines in stock price. Walgreens Boots Alliance's decline can be attributed to its struggles in the pharmacy business, competing with big players like CVS and Amazon. Intel's decline is due to its struggles in the chip space, with a new CEO and government money not being enough to turn the company around.\n\nThe year also saw several investing discoveries, including the use of NotebookLM, a large language model, to help with research and planning. Ricky Mulvey also discovered the importance of following CEOs' buying activity, as it can be a strong indicator of a company's potential. Asit Sharma also discovered the use of social media sentiment and stock sentiment to understand how news flows about a company are trending.\n\nThe year ended with a discussion of non-investing related discoveries, including word processors and thrillers. Asit Sharma recommended a minimalist word processor, while Ricky Mulvey recommended the thrillers of Jordan Harper.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
