  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

Futures of major benchmark indices were lower in premarket. The Donald Trump administration levied a 245% tariff on China late Tuesday. The U.S. government also announced new export restrictions halting the shipments of Nvidia Corp.'s H20 graphics processing units to China.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury bond yielded 4.31% and the two-year bond was at 3.81%. The CME Group's FedWatch tool's projections show markets pricing a 79.9% likelihood of the Federal Reserve keeping the current interest rates unchanged in its May meeting.\n\nFutures Change: Dow Jones -0.07%, S&P 500 -0.44%, Nasdaq 100 -1.08%, Russell 2000 -0.35%. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ) fell in premarket on Wednesday.\n\nCues From Last Session: The consumer discretionary, health care, and consumer staples sectors saw the biggest declines. However, information technology and real estate stocks closed higher. Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings.\n\nIndex Performance: Nasdaq Composite -0.049%, S&P 500 -0.17%, Dow Jones -0.38%, Russell 2000 0.11%. The Dow closed 10.44% below its 52-week peak, the S&P 500 ended 12.21% off its high, and the Nasdaq 100 was 15.27% below its record.\n\nAnalysts' Insights: Mona Mahajan of Edward Jones stated that market valuations were no longer stretched, and the upside is that valuations are now looking more compelling. Jason Goepfert of White Oak Consultancy LLC noted a historical pattern where the VIX fear index dropping from above 50 to 30 has historically achieved 100% positive gains by year-end.\n\nUpcoming Economic Data: March's U.S. retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilization data for March, business inventories for February, and the home builder confidence index for April will be announced.\n\nStocks In Focus: Abbott Laboratories (ABT) rose 0.74% in premarket, Travelers Companies Inc. (TRV) was up 0.076%, and Progressive Corp. (PGR) fell 0.01%.\n[Output in JSON]\n",

The timeline is designed to be plausible, novel, elaborated, and actionable, meeting the specified criteria.\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Plausibility**: The events and responses are grounded in current economic and geopolitical realities, making them plausible.\n2. **Novelty**: The timeline explores various paths and outcomes, including less obvious consequences such as sector rotation and diversification efforts by tech companies.\n3. **Elaboration**: Each node provides a detailed description of the event or response, including potential impacts on markets and sectors.\n4. **Actionable**: The timeline offers insights that can inform investment decisions, such as rotating into less sensitive sectors or hedging against potential downturns in specific industries.\n\n### Investment Implications:\n- **Short-term**: Investors may consider hedging against trade war escalation and potential economic downturns.\n- **Long-term**: Diversification into sectors less affected by trade tensions, such as consumer staples, and companies with robust diversification strategies may be beneficial.\n\n### Risk Management:\n- Monitoring trade negotiations and geopolitical developments closely.\n- Adjusting portfolios based on upcoming economic data releases and their implications for monetary policy and market sentiment.\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the potential impacts of the U.S. tariffs and export restrictions, enabling informed investment decisions and risk management strategies.",
