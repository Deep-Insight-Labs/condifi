  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The top five companies by market capitalization have a combined value of $14.9 trillion, representing 28.8% of the index. These companies are Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, and they are forecast to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on artificial intelligence (AI) this year. \n\nApple recently launched its Apple Intelligence software, which includes AI-powered writing tools and a Siri voice assistant upgrade. The company's latest chips, the A18 Pro, M3, and M4, were specifically designed for processing AI workloads on-device. Apple has over 2.2 billion devices worldwide, making it a potential major distributor of AI to consumers.\n\nNvidia is the leading supplier of graphics processors (GPUs) for developing AI, and its new Blackwell GB200 GPUs offer a substantial leap in performance. Demand for Blackwell chips is significantly outstripping supply, and Nvidia is on track to generate a record $128.6 billion in total revenue during fiscal 2025, followed by almost $200 billion in fiscal 2026.\n\nMicrosoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI and launched its own AI virtual assistant called Copilot, which is now embedded in its flagship software products. The company allocated $55.7 billion to capital expenditures during its fiscal 2024, most of which was related to AI data centers and chips. Microsoft is on track to invest a record amount in its AI ambitions during the current year.\n\nAlphabet, the parent company of Google, launched its own family of AI models, called Gemini, to protect its dominance in the internet search business. The company is using AI to change how Google Search responds to queries, and its new AI Overviews feature incorporates text, images, and links to third-party websites to provide a more holistic answer to almost any question.\n\nAmazon is integrating AI into the entire customer experience, offering a virtual shopping assistant called Rufus and using a tool called Project Private Investigator to identify defective products before they're shipped out. Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated $27.4 billion in total revenue during the third quarter of 2024, with AI revenue soaring by a triple-digit percentage. Amazon allocated around $75 billion to AI capital expenditures during 2024, and it's likely to spend even more in 2025 to cement its leadership position.\n[Output in JSON]\n",

The initial event is the surge in AI spending by Big Tech companies, which branches out into three main paths: AI adoption accelerating across industries, regulatory backlash against Big Tech's AI dominance, and AI-driven market volatility.\n\nThe timeline includes various nodes representing potential events, such as productivity gains, new business models, increased competition, antitrust investigations, data privacy concerns, and AI ethics guidelines. Each node is described in detail, and some have children nodes that further elaborate on the potential consequences.\n\nThe timeline is designed to be plausible, novel, and elaborative, meeting the specified criteria. It provides a comprehensive and nuanced exploration of the potential outcomes related to the scenario, including sector impacts, asset class consequences, and opportunities.\n\nSome potential investment actions or hedging strategies that can be informed by this timeline include:\n\n* Long positions in semiconductor stocks, such as Nvidia, due to sustained demand for AI chips\n* Investments in cloud computing and data center stocks, driven by growing demand for AI infrastructure\n* Short positions in traditional industries that may be disrupted by AI adoption\n* Long positions in companies that are well-positioned to benefit from AI-driven productivity gains and new business models\n\nOverall, this timeline provides a rich and detailed exploration of the potential outcomes related to the scenario, offering valuable insights for investment decisions and risk management.",
