Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The earnings season gathers momentum in the final week of January when mega-cap tech companies, including Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Apple, release their quarterly updates.\n\nAnalysts expect annualized profit growth of +11.9% and an increase of +4.6% in revenue growth. The sector is expected to report the largest annualized earnings growth rate of all eleven sectors, at +39.5%, while the sector is forecast to come in second, with +20.7% year-over-year EPS growth.\n\nThe sector is expected to report the third-highest annualized earnings growth rate, at +14%. In contrast, earnings from the sector, which includes oil and gas giants such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources, Schlumberger, and Kinder Morgan, are expected to tumble -24.6% compared to last year.\n\nThe S&P 500 is expected to report annualized sales growth of +4.6%, compared to expectations for revenue growth of +5.2% at the end of September. Eight sectors are projected to report year-over-year growth in revenues, led by the Information Technology and Utilities sectors, at +11.1% and +8.0%, respectively.\n\nUsing the InvestingPro Stock Screener, 38 stocks were identified that are forecast to deliver growth of more than 25% in both earnings per share and revenue. Notable tech-related names include Astera Labs, Nvidia, Coinbase, Super Micro Computer, Reddit, Robinhood, Seagate, Western Digital, AppLovin, Trade Desk, DraftKings, CrowdStrike, Cloudflare, Snowflake, and Palantir.\n\nCVX, or Chevron, is expected to report a -24.6% year-over-year earnings decline, the worst drop of any sector by far. This is due to the sector's exposure to the Energy sector, which is expected to report a -3.2% year-over-year decline in revenue.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
