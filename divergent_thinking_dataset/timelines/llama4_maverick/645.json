  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

Eight of the 30 Dow components lost value in 2024, with Boeing and Nike being the worst-performing stocks. Both companies have new CEOs and low expectations, making them potential turnaround candidates. \n\nBoeing has a 50% decline over the last five years and cut its dividend during the pandemic, while Nike has a 2.1% dividend yield and is exposed to international markets. \n\nThe healthcare sector, which makes up 10% of the S&P 500, was heavily sold off in the final three months of 2024, but its stocks could beat the S&P 500 in 2025 if investors shift towards value stocks. Amgen, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, and UnitedHealth Group have fallen to attractive valuations based on forward earnings guidance. \n\nAmgen has a 3.5% dividend yield and is developing a weight loss drug, while Merck has a 3.2% yield and is facing increased competition. Johnson & Johnson has a 3.4% yield and 60 consecutive years of dividend increases, but its growth has been disappointing. UnitedHealth has a 1.6% yield and has been recovering after controversy and regulatory concerns. \n\nMcDonald's and Chevron are also recommended as dividend stocks to buy and hold long-term. McDonald's has a 2.5% yield and 48 consecutive years of dividend increases, while Chevron has a 4.1% yield and 37 consecutive years of dividend increases.\n[Output in JSON]\n",

The initial event (T0) is the strong 2024 market performance and the emergence of potential turnarounds and value opportunities. The timeline branches into three main paths:\n\n1. Investors shift to value stocks (T1A1), leading to healthcare stocks outperforming and dividend stocks attracting income investors.\n2. Boeing and Nike turnarounds gain traction (T1A2), with Boeing's operational improvements driving aerospace sector gains and Nike's international exposure weighing on results.\n3. Global economic growth slows (T1A3), resulting in commodity prices declining and central banks responding with monetary easing.\n\nEach node represents a specific event or outcome, with descriptions and date ranges providing context. The timeline is designed to be plausible, novel, and elaborated, with actionable insights for investment decisions.",
