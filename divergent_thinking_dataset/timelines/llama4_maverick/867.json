Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

Morgan, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, BMO, Deutsche Bank, RBC, Barclays, and Wells Fargo, expect the S&P 500 to reach between 6500-7000 by the end of 2025. However, a recent market analysis service notes that this consensus is likely due to herding behavior, as analysts tend to follow the prevailing trend. \n\nHistorically, Wall Street analysts have been inaccurate in their forecasts, with 59% of their predictions missing their targets by more than 15%. A study found that analysts had a mere 1 in 170 chance of being within 5% of the actual number. In 2000, analysts predicted a 37% increase in stock prices, but the market fell 16%, and in 2008, they predicted a 28% increase, but the market fell 40%. \n\nAnalysts' forecasts have been consistently inconsistent, missing the market by an annual rate of 31.3% on average. A study of 4000 corporate earnings estimates found that experts' predictions exhibit positive bias and disappointing accuracy, often attributed to incomplete knowledge, incompetence, or misrepresentation.\n[Output in JSON]\n",

output represents a timeline of possible events based on the given scenario. The initial event is the prediction by Wall Street analysts that the S&P 500 will reach 6500-7000 by 2025. The timeline branches into different possibilities based on whether the herding behavior continues or a contrarian view gains traction.\n\nThe first branch (T1A1) assumes that the herding behavior continues, and analysts maintain their high forecasts. This leads to two possible outcomes: the market reaches the predicted levels (T1A1.1) or fails to do so (T1A1.2). If the market reaches the predicted levels, concerns about overvaluation may arise, potentially leading to a market correction (T2A1). If the market fails to reach the predicted levels, investors may lose confidence in analysts' predictions, leading to increased market volatility (T2A2).\n\nThe second branch (T1A2) assumes that a contrarian view gains traction, and alternative forecasts predicting lower S&P 500 levels emerge. This leads to two possible outcomes: the contrarian view gains traction and the market declines (T1A2.1), or the contrarian view fails to gain traction, and the market continues to rise (T1A2.2).\n\nThe timeline is designed to be plausible, novel, elaborated, and actionable, meeting the required criteria. It provides a detailed and nuanced exploration of possible events, allowing investors to consider different scenarios and adjust their strategies accordingly.",
