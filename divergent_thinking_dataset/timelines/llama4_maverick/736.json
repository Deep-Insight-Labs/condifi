  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) jumped 56% to $142 million, and GAAP earnings per share of $1.67 topped estimates of $1.40. \n\nThe company's bookings pipeline is robust, with over $5 billion in annual bookings in 2024, representing nearly five years' worth of total revenue. This is driven by high-value, long-term contracts, and the company has annual recurring revenue of $1 billion, primarily from its cloud products. \n\nAxon is expanding beyond law enforcement into the private sector, with its largest deal ever coming from an enterprise customer, a global logistics provider. This shows the opportunity for the company to tap into untraditional markets, such as security companies and transportation workers. \n\nThe addressable market for Axon is estimated to be $129 billion, with the company having only penetrated 2% of that market currently. This indicates a large growth opportunity for the company, which will continue to innovate with new technology and bring new companies into the fold through acquisitions. \n\nKey financial information: \n- Revenue growth of 34% in the fourth quarter to $575.1 million\n- Adjusted EBITDA of $142 million, up 56% from the previous year\n- GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, beating estimates of $1.40\n- Annual recurring revenue of $1 billion, primarily from cloud products\n- Bookings pipeline of over $5 billion in 2024, representing nearly five years' worth of total revenue\n\nKey economic and political information: \n- The company's expansion into the private sector and untraditional markets\n- The large growth opportunity for the company in the addressable market of $129 billion\n- The company's ability to innovate with new technology and bring new companies into the fold through acquisitions\n\nRelevant information for a professional investor: \n- The company's strong earnings and revenue growth\n- The robust bookings pipeline and high-value, long-term contracts\n- The expansion into the private sector and untraditional markets\n- The large growth opportunity in the addressable market of $129 billion\n- The company's ability to innovate with new technology and bring new companies into the fold through acquisitions.\n[Output in JSON]\n",

The initial event (T0) is the earnings report, which leads to three possible branches:\n\n1. **Investors React Positively (T1A1)**: The stock price surges, and analysts upgrade the company. This leads to increased institutional investment, further expansion into new markets, and potentially more analyst coverage.\n2. **Regulatory Scrutiny Increases (T1A2)**: Regulators examine Axon's expansion into new markets, potentially impacting growth. This could lead to increased compliance costs, delays in new contracts, and adjustments to Axon's business strategy.\n3. **Competition Intensifies (T1A3)**: Competitors respond to Axon's success by innovating and expanding their own offerings. This could lead to market share shifts, Axon maintaining its market lead, or industry consolidation.\n\nEach branch represents a possible path, with varying degrees of plausibility, novelty, elaboration, and actionable insights.
