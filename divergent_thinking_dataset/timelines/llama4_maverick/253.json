  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The global hydrogen market production is anticipated to be 685.18 million metric tons in 2050. The market is driven by increasing demand for hydrogen-based fuels, growing focus on industrial decarbonization and desulfurization, and ongoing developments in steel and power generation industries.\n\nThe global hydrogen market demand has been rapidly growing in recent years due to hydrogen's potential to act as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, particularly in the power generation and transportation sectors. The increasing proliferation of applications is a major driver behind the growing demand, although industrial demand itself will also rise.\n\nThe market is segmented by technology into steam methane reforming, electrolysis, coal gasification, and others, with steam methane reforming being the largest segment. Electrolysis is the fastest-growing segment due to increased need for renewable energy sources and favorable government policies.\n\nThe market is also segmented by sector into existing industry use, mobility, power generation, building and industry heat, and new industry feedstock, with the hydrogen demand for mobility expected to grow at a fast pace in the forecasted period.\n\nThe global hydrogen market is expected to be driven by factors such as increasing usage of ammonia-based fertilizers, favorable government policies and initiatives, rising demand to decarbonize energy end-use, and increasing use of hydrogen as rocket propellants.\n\nThe key players in the hydrogen market are BP, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Nel ASA, Linde plc, FuelCell Energy, Inc., Iwatani Corporation, Messer SE, Air Liquide, SOL Group, First Hydrogen Corp., and Lhyfe SAS.\n\nThe Asia Pacific region is the largest and fastest-growing region in the global hydrogen market, driven by rising demand for clean energy, strong presence of refineries in major countries such as China and India, and favorable government policies.\n\nThe US is the largest region within North America, with the US Infrastructure and Jobs Act budgeting US$9.5 billion for research, development, and demonstration for hydrogen-related projects until 2026.\n[Output in JSON]\n",

The initial event is the current growth trend in the hydrogen market, driven by increasing demand for clean energy and favorable government policies.\n\nThe first branch (H1A1) represents a scenario where government support continues to drive growth in the hydrogen market. This leads to increased adoption of electrolysis, industrial decarbonization, and growth in the mobility sector. As infrastructure development follows, major automakers increase production of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, ultimately leading to a mature global hydrogen economy.\n\nThe second branch (H1A2) represents a scenario where supply chain constraints hinder growth. High production costs and infrastructure bottlenecks slow adoption, but technological innovation leads to breakthroughs in hydrogen production, ultimately driving accelerated adoption.\n\nThe third branch (H1A3) represents a scenario where geopolitical shifts drive growth in the Asia Pacific region. China and India lead demand growth, and countries invest in domestic hydrogen production to reduce reliance on imports. Regional hydrogen economies emerge, and eventually, global hydrogen trade begins.\n\nThis timeline meets the criteria for high quality:\n\n* Plausibility: Each branch is supported by current trends and data in the hydrogen market.\n* Novelty: The timeline explores different scenarios and identifies potential risks and opportunities.\n* Elaboration: Each node provides specific details on the developments and their consequences.\n* Actionable: The timeline provides insights that can inform investment decisions and hedging strategies in the hydrogen market.",
