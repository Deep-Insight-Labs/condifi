  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The market is driven by the increasing incidence of cerebrovascular illnesses such as stroke, TIA, carotid artery disease, and risk factors including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. The elderly population's growth also contributes to the increasing incidence of brain ischemia.\n\nThe market is segmented by treatment, condition type, end-user, and region. Angioplasty dominates the treatment segment, followed by beta blockers and ACE inhibitors. Focal brain ischemia has the largest market share in the condition type segment, followed by global brain ischemia. Hospitals and clinics are the largest end-users of brain ischemia treatments.\n\nNorth America has the largest market share in the brain ischemia market, followed by the Asia-Pacific region. The market in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow at the fastest rate due to the rapid economic growth, advancement of medical facilities, and awareness among people about stroke prevention and treatment.\n\nKey players in the brain ischemia market include Abbott, Johnson & Johnson Private Limited, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Novartis AG, Bayer AG, AstraZeneca, Merck KGaA, H. Lundbeck A/S, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Taxus Cardium Pharmaceuticals Group (CRXM), Boston Scientific Corporation, and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation.\n\nThe brain ischemia market is expected to grow due to the increasing awareness of stroke symptoms and the need for early treatments. The market is also driven by the development of new technologies and treatments, such as angioplasty, thrombolytic and mechanical thrombectomy devices, and neuroprotective drugs.\n\nThe report covers the qualitative and quantitative data on the global brain ischemia market, including the latest trends, market players analysis, market drivers, market opportunity, and many others. The report also provides a comprehensive analysis of the market, including the market size, growth rate, and segmentation by treatment, condition type, end-user, and region.\n\nThe report is available for purchase from Intellectual Market Insights, a global market intelligence and consulting organization that provides syndicated research reports, customized research reports, and consulting services.
