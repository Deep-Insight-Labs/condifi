  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

Key players in the market include Caterpillar, Liebherr, Komatsu, Volvo, and Hitachi Construction Machinery. Earthmoving equipment accounted for the largest market share in 2023, with excavators in the earthmoving segment accounting for the largest share. The country's investment in renovating its public infrastructure drives the growth of the Dutch earthmoving market.\n\nThe demand for material handling equipment is also growing due to the rising number of wind power projects and the development of warehouses and logistics parks across the country. Road rollers sales are high in the Netherlands in response to the rising renovation and expansion of public transit and airports.\n\nThe Dutch construction industry is expected to recover in 2025, mainly due to the rise in new build production of homes. Technological innovations such as prefabricated construction, 3D printing, and the use of digital building models (BIM) offer opportunities to work more efficiently and increase labor productivity.\n\nThe Netherlands is going through a significant nitrogen crisis, and the government has introduced a scheme \"Subsidy Scheme Clean and Emission-free Construction Equipment (SSEB)\" which can be applied for several parts and the maximum subsidy amount per construction machine is USD 316 thousand.\n\nEconomic challenges like inflation, rising interest rates, and a global slowdown have slowed the Dutch construction industry. The country is witnessing a severe housing shortage, with the estimated shortage increasing from 291,000 to 401,000 homes since 2022. The Dutch government has raised its housing target from 900,000 to 981,000 new homes by 2030.\n\nThe Netherlands construction equipment market is expected to witness a grid congestion challenge in 2025, as the limited capacity of the electricity grid causes delays in many construction projects. The grid congestion is a challenge witnessed in the Almere region of the Netherlands, and similar issues are emerging in other cities.\n\nProminent vendors in the market include Caterpillar, Volvo Construction Equipment, Komatsu, Hitachi Construction Machinery, Liebherr, JCB, SANY, Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group Co. Ltd. (XCMG), Kobelco, HD Hyundai Construction Equipment, CASE Construction Equipment, Kubota, and others.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
