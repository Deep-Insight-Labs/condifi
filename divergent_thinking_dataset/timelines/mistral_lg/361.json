  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

Three AI stocks to consider are Meta Platforms (META), Salesforce (CRM), and Nvidia (NVDA). \n\nMeta Platforms is competing in the generative AI model game with its open-source model, Llama, which gives it a training advantage over competitors. Salesforce is focusing on serving its existing client base with useful AI platforms, including its Agentforce, which allows users to create AI agents for tasks such as customer support. Nvidia plays a key role in any AI model, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) used to train AI models, and its next-generation GPU architecture, Blackwell, providing massive improvements in training performance.\n\nThe stocks are considered great buys now due to their fairly priced valuations relative to their growth. Meta has a 24 times forward earnings valuation, making it the cheapest stock on the list. Salesforce has a 30 times forward earnings valuation, but has the most to gain from its AI investments. Nvidia has a 48 times forward earnings valuation, but is growing the fastest, with revenue expected to rise by 50% this year.\n\nKey financial information:\n\n- Meta Platforms: 24 times forward earnings valuation\n- Salesforce: 30 times forward earnings valuation\n- Nvidia: 48 times forward earnings valuation\n- Meta Platforms' open-source model, Llama\n- Salesforce's Agentforce\n- Nvidia's next-generation GPU architecture, Blackwell\n- Nvidia's revenue expected to rise by 50% this year\n\nEconomic and political information:\n\n- AI investing is expected to be a significant theme in 2025\n- Nvidia's dominant market position\n- Salesforce's need for growth, with Wall Street projecting 9% growth this year\n\nRelevant information for professional investors:\n\n- The stocks are considered great buys now due to their fairly priced valuations relative to their growth\n- Meta has a dominant and innovative position in the AI market\n- Salesforce has the most to gain from its AI investments\n- Nvidia has a dominant market position and is growing the fastest.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
