Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

Since 1973, dividend growth stocks have beaten the S&P 500 index by 2.5 percentage points annually. \n\nASML, a semiconductor equipment manufacturer, holds a dominant leadership position in the lithography industry with a 50% market share and a near-monopoly in extreme-ultraviolet units. Management expects sales to grow between 9% and 16% through 2025. ASML's shares are down 33% from their highs, making it a potential buy opportunity.\n\nWingstop, a chicken wing franchisor, offers a rare combination of immense dividend growth potential and supercharged revenue growth. The company has grown its store count by 17% in the third quarter, resulting in a 39% revenue increase. Wingstop's shares have declined nearly 30% due to its high valuation, but it now has a similar valuation to its peer, Chipotle Mexican Grill.\n\nZoetis, a well-diversified leader in animal health, provides medicines, vaccines, and other precision services. The company has a strong track record of free cash flow growth, and its recent launch of new osteoarthritis medicines for cats and dogs could drive further growth. Zoetis' dividend has grown by 29% annually over the last decade, and its shares offer a 1% dividend yield.\n\nAll three stocks have a payout ratio below 33%, leaving room for future dividend hikes. They offer investors substantial passive income potential, with ASML and Zoetis having grown their dividends by 24% and 29% annually over the last decade, respectively. Wingstop's dividend growth story is also impressive, with a 18% annual growth rate since starting payouts in 2017.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
