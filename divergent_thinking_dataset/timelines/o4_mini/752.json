  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The market is driven by intensified construction demands, stricter safety regulations, and a desire for robust infrastructure. Key types of conduits include Rigid Metal Conduit (RMC), Electrical Metallic Tubing (EMT), Intermediate Metal Conduit (IMC), Flexible Metal Conduit (FMC), and Liquidtight Flexible Metal Conduit (LFMC), with steel being the most widely used material due to its high tensile strength.\n\nTop drivers of the market include surging demand for robust cable protection, growing preference for corrosion-resistant coatings, and increased installations supporting large-scale renewable power infrastructure deployments. Key trends include accelerated integration of digital monitoring within advanced conduit systems, rising use of lightweight steel alloys, and widespread adoption of pre-assembled conduit kits.\n\nRigid Metal Conduit (RMC) has proven its worth in safeguarding electrical wiring against physical damage and tampering, and is expected to continue its growth due to its importance in heavy-duty environments. Key developments include the adoption of hot-dip galvanized RMC for healthcare facilities, introduction of new RMC variants for sub-zero climates, and the use of RMC in desalination complexes.\n\nSteel remains the principal material for conduits, with a 40% share of total conduit usage, and is expected to continue its dominance due to its reliability, tensile strength, and adaptability. Key developments include the development of specialized coatings for steel conduits, adoption of steel conduits in automotive and building projects, and the use of steel conduits in industrial facilities.\n\nIndustrial facilities have a 30% share of total conduit deployment, and are expected to continue their demand for robust solutions suitable for oil refineries, manufacturing floors, and chemical plants. Key developments include the use of steel or heavy-grade RMC in petrochemical companies, testing of corrosion-proof coatings on conduits, and the use of specialized conduit clamps in pharmaceutical production lines.\n\nThe metal electrical conduit market is expected to undergo significant advancements in 2024 and beyond, driven by globalization, environmental imperatives, and digital integration. Key developments include the introduction of automated welding systems for conduit seams, development of new conduit alloys, and the exploration of fully recyclable steel conduit lines.\n\nKey players in the market include Atkore International Group Inc., Schneider Electric, Thomas & Betts (ABB Ltd.), Legrand SA, Eaton Corporation, Mitsubishi Coporation, Nippon Steel Corporation, PMT Corporation, Anamet Electrical, Inc., and Wheatland Tube. The market is segmented by type, material type, application, end user, and region.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
