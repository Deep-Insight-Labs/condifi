Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The company has nearly 3.3 billion active daily users across its apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. Its average revenue per person metric was $11.89 last quarter, with a 12-month average of $46.35 per user. Meta is investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve user engagement and ad effectiveness. However, the company's Reality Lab segment posted a $4.5 billion operating loss last quarter, highlighting the significant investment in the Metaverse.\n\nPinterest (PINS) was down 18% in 2024, but the company has made significant strides in monetizing its user base, particularly in the U.S. and Canada. The company has 537 million monthly active users, with a strong focus on women. Pinterest has integrated AI into its platform to improve recommendations and ad relevance, and has formed partnerships with Amazon and Google to better monetize its user base. However, the company's average revenue per user (ARPU) remains low, at $1.70 last quarter, with significant opportunities for growth in international markets.\n\nSnap (SNAP) was down 34% in 2024, but the company is poised for growth in 2025 with its redesign of the Snapchat app. The new design aims to declutter the app and focus on pictures, chatting with friends, and short-form video entertainment. The company has 443 million active users, with a strong focus on younger audiences. Snap has done a better job of monetizing international users, with ARPU of $1.09 last quarter in the Rest of World category. The company's adjusted EBITDA soared 229% last quarter, and it is well-positioned to benefit if TikTok is banned.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
