Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

Agentic AI uses autonomous agents to solve complex problems and is a key application of generative AI beyond chatbots. Agentforce allows users to build and customize autonomous AI agents that can serve employees and customers 24/7, with Salesforce reporting an 83% resolution rate for visitor requests on its help site.\n\nSalesforce has signed 200 deals with Agentforce and has an \"incredible\" pipeline, according to CEO Marc Benioff. The product has expanded the company's total addressable market (TAM) significantly, creating a new market that is \"so much bigger and so much more exciting\" than the data management market.\n\nAgentforce has the potential to deliver high-margin profits for Salesforce as it is highly scalable and has a marginal cost of delivery that is essentially zero. The incremental revenue from Agentforce is likely to be mostly profit, as the research and development necessary to create the product has already been done.\n\nSalesforce's revenue growth rate has slowed in recent quarters, coming in at 8.3% in the third quarter, but the company guided for 7% to 9% revenue growth and 9% remaining performance obligations (RPO) growth for the fourth quarter. It will likely take a few more quarters for Agentforce to begin to impact the company's growth, as it was launched in September.\n\nThe potential of software programs like Agentforce is massive, with a huge value-add and productivity improvement that Salesforce's customers are likely to pay up for. Cloud infrastructure companies have been willing to spend tens of billions of dollars on Nvidia components to build out AI infrastructure, and Salesforce is likely to be a key beneficiary of this trend.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
