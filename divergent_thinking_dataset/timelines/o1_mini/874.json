Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

However, non-investors can still tap into the market's potential returns of around 10% per year. To start investing, one can read books on investing, such as \"The Intelligent Investor\" and \"Common Sense Investing\", and observe market commentary without acting on it. \n\nEnrolling in a 401(k) plan is a good starting point, as it allows automatic deductions from one's paycheck and investment in a diversified portfolio. Alternatively, one can open a brokerage account or IRA with a broker like Charles Schwab, which can be used to purchase stocks, mutual funds, or bonds. \n\nFunding these accounts can be done with a check or bank transfer, and investments can be made through online platforms or with the help of a live representative. It's essential to remember that investing is a long-term venture and to ride out occasional setbacks in the value of one's portfolio. \n\nKey financial information: \n- The US stock market is worth around $60 trillion.\n- The top 1% of families own 50% of the market.\n- The top 10% own 87% of the market.\n- Non-investors can still tap into the market's potential returns of around 10% per year.\n- One can start investing with less than $1,000 or as little as $100 per month.\n- A brokerage account or IRA can be used to purchase stocks, mutual funds, or bonds.\n\nKey economic information: \n- The US stock market is a significant component of the country's economy.\n- Investing in the stock market can provide a long-term return of around 10% per year.\n- The market can be volatile, with occasional setbacks in the value of one's portfolio.\n\nKey political information: \n- The US tax code allows for tax-free growth of investments in IRAs.\n- The annual contribution cap for IRAs is a key consideration for investors.\n- The availability of 401(k) plans and other retirement benefits can vary by employer.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
