Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The earnings season gathers momentum in the final week of January when mega-cap tech companies, including Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Apple, release their quarterly updates.\n\nAnalysts expect annualized profit growth of +11.9% and an increase of +4.6% in revenue growth. The sector is expected to report the largest annualized earnings growth rate of all eleven sectors, at +39.5%, while the sector is forecast to come in second, with +20.7% year-over-year EPS growth.\n\nThe sector is expected to report the third-highest annualized earnings growth rate, at +14%. In contrast, earnings from the sector, which includes oil and gas giants, are expected to tumble -24.6% compared to last year - the worst drop of any sector by far.\n\nThe sector is projected to report the second worst Y-o-Y earnings slump of all eleven sectors, with EPS set to decline -3.8% from a year earlier. In terms of revenue expectations, analysts have also decreased their estimates during the quarter, with the S&P 500 expected to report annualized sales growth of +4.6%.\n\n38 stocks are forecast to deliver growth of more than 25% in both earnings per share and revenue, including Astera Labs, Nvidia, Coinbase, Super Micro Computer, Reddit, Robinhood, Seagate, Western Digital, AppLovin, Trade Desk, DraftKings, CrowdStrike, Cloudflare, Snowflake, and Palantir.\n\nNotable stocks to watch for that are also projected to deliver double-digit Q4 earnings and sales growth include Eli Lilly, Newmont, Jeffries Financial, Blackstone, Prudential Financial, Affirm, Axon Enterprise, Comfort Systems, Toast, and On Holding.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
