  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a high-quality timeline based on the given scenario about the global temperature sensors market. The scenario provides growth projections, key drivers, challenges, and regional highlights. The output needs to be a JSON structure with a tree-like timeline that meets the criteria for plausibility, novelty, elaboration, and actionable insights.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main actors and stakeholders. The key players here are the sensor manufacturers (like ABB, Honeywell, Texas Instruments), industries adopting these sensors (healthcare, automotive, smart homes), governments in high-growth regions (India, Brazil, China, USA, Germany), and possibly regulatory bodies. Competitors and new entrants are also stakeholders due to the mentioned price competition.\n\nNext, extrapolate how the situation might evolve. The market is growing at 4.3% CAGR, with India and Brazil leading in growth rates. Drivers include healthcare, Industry 4.0/IoT, and wearables. Challenges are price competition and margin pressures.\n\nStarting with the initial event: the projected market growth. From there, possible branches could be technological advancements, regulatory changes, market consolidation, or geopolitical factors affecting supply chains.\n\nFor plausibility, each branch should be grounded in real-world dynamics. For example, if India's growth is high, maybe government policies there could spur local manufacturing, affecting global players. Or, advancements in IoT might lead to new applications, increasing demand further.\n\nNovelty is important. Maybe consider unexpected alliances, like sensor companies partnering with pharmaceutical firms for vaccine storage, or new entrants from adjacent markets (like semiconductor companies diversifying into sensors). Another angle could be environmental policies accelerating sensor adoption in emerging markets.\n\nElaboration requires specific nodes. Instead of just \"market grows,\" detail how specific sectors react. For example, a node could be \"Honeywell launches low-cost sensors for Indian smart cities, undercutting local players,\" which leads to price wars or innovation in cost-reduction techniques.\n\nActionable insights mean linking nodes to investment strategies. If a company is expanding in India, maybe long on their stock. If there's a supply chain issue with rare materials, shorting companies reliant on those materials.\n\nPossible timeline branches:\n\n1. Technological Innovation: Companies invest in R&D to overcome price pressures. This could lead to breakthroughs (like self-calibrating sensors) or new applications (e.g., in climate monitoring).\n\n2. Regulatory Changes: Stricter food safety laws in Brazil increase sensor demand. Or, data privacy concerns in the EU affect IoT deployment.\n\n3. Market Consolidation: Price wars lead to mergers, with big players acquiring smaller ones. This affects stock valuations and creates opportunities in M&A arbitrage.\n\n4. Geopolitical Issues: Trade tensions between US and China impact semiconductor supply chains, affecting sensor production. Companies might shift manufacturing to India or Vietnam.\n\n5. Emerging Markets Growth: India's push for smart cities and digital infrastructure drives demand, but local companies might gain market share, challenging global leaders.\n\nEach of these branches needs to be fleshed out with specific events, dates, and consequences. For example, under technological innovation, a node could be \"2026: Breakthrough in biodegradable sensors reduces environmental impact, opening new markets in eco-conscious regions.\"\n\nAlso, considering feedback loops. For instance, if IoT adoption increases, it might lead to more data collection, which could trigger privacy regulations, affecting sensor market growth. Or, successful healthcare wearables could lead to more health monitoring mandates, further driving sensor demand.\n\nPotential investment actions: Long on companies with strong R&D pipelines, short on those reliant on outdated tech. Investing in Indian tech ETFs if local growth is favorable. Monitoring trade policies for supply chain risks.\n\nNeed to ensure each node is specific, with clear actors and mechanisms. Avoid vague terms. For example, instead of \"market reacts,\" specify \"Honeywell's stock rises 15% after securing a contract with Indian government for smart city projects.\"\n\nFinally, structure the JSON with parent and child nodes, each with unique IDs, titles, descriptions, and possible date ranges. Ensure the tree reflects branching possibilities based on different responses to each event.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"Global temperature sensors market projected to grow at 4.3% CAGR (2025-2035), driven by healthcare, Industry 4.0/IoT, and wearables.
