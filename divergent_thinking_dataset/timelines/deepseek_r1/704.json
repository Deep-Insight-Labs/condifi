  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a high-quality timeline based on a scenario, but the given scenario is about an earnings calendar tool, not a news event. Wait, the example they provided had a news article about Trump's auto tariffs, but the actual scenario here is just a description of an earnings calendar tool. That's a bit confusing.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the user is asking for. They mentioned there's no actual news article, only a description of an earnings calendar tool. But the example output was based on a news scenario. Maybe the user made a mistake in the input? Or perhaps they want me to create a hypothetical scenario around an earnings calendar tool and then build a timeline from that.\n\nBut the user's initial instruction was to generate a timeline given a scenario, considering actors, stakeholders, and possible responses. However, the provided scenario is about an earnings calendar tool, which isn't a geopolitical or economic event. That's a problem because the example given (auto tariffs) is a geopolitical/economic event with clear actors and stakeholders. An earnings calendar tool is a product, so the stakeholders would be companies, investors, maybe regulators.\n\nWait, maybe the user intended to provide a different scenario but pasted the wrong one. The example input was a news article, but the given scenario is about an earnings calendar. That's conflicting. But since the user provided the example and then said \"Given Scenario: There is no actual news article provided, only a description of an earnings calendar tool,\" perhaps they want me to generate a timeline based on the hypothetical release or impact of an earnings calendar tool.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd. An earnings calendar tool is a tool used by investors to track when companies report earnings. The release of such a tool might not have significant market-moving events unless it's a new product that changes how information is disseminated. Maybe if the tool has advanced features, like predictive analytics, that could affect market behavior.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and intended to provide a different scenario. But given the instructions, I need to work with what's provided. Let's proceed under the assumption that the scenario is about the launch of a new advanced earnings calendar tool by a major financial data provider (like Bloomberg or Reuters) that uses AI to predict earnings surprises, which could impact market behavior.\n\nActors and stakeholders would include the financial data provider, investors (both retail and institutional), regulators (SEC, etc.), companies being analyzed, competitors in the financial data space, and possibly market manipulators.\n\nPossible timeline branches could involve how the tool's predictions affect trading behavior, regulatory responses if the tool is seen as giving unfair advantage, market reactions to accurate vs. inaccurate predictions, and competitive responses from other data providers.\n\nNow, considering the criteria: plausibility, novelty, elaboration, and actionable insights.\n\nPlausibility: The tool's release leading to changes in trading patterns is plausible. For example, if the tool accurately predicts earnings surprises, front-running could occur. Regulators might scrutinize if it's considered insider information.\n\nNovelty: Exploring how AI-driven tools could create self-fulfilling prophecies or market distortions is a creative angle. For example, if the tool's predictions cause investors to act in a way that actually affects company performance.\n\nElaboration: Each node should be specific, like \"SEC investigates predictive tool for potential market manipulation\" with details on mechanisms.\n\nActionable: Investment strategies could involve shorting stocks predicted to underperform, or buying volatility instruments if the tool's predictions increase market uncertainty.\n\nPutting this together, the timeline would start with the tool's launch, then branch into regulatory responses, market adoption, competitive reactions, and potential market impacts. Each node needs to be detailed and plausible, with investment implications.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Launch of AI-Predictive Earnings Calendar Tool\",\n  \"description\": \"Major financial data provider (e.g., Bloomberg/Refinitiv) releases AI-driven earnings calendar with predictive analytics for EPS surprises (±5% accuracy edge vs. consensus).
