  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a high-quality timeline based on the given scenario about the NUT midline carcinoma treatment market. The scenario provides market size data, growth projections, regional breakdowns, treatment segments, and key players. The goal is to create a timeline that's plausible, novel, elaborate, and actionable.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main actors and stakeholders. The key players here are pharmaceutical companies like Novartis, Roche, Gilead, etc. Then there are research institutions, healthcare providers (hospitals, specialty clinics), regulatory bodies (FDA, EMA), investors, and patients. Each of these stakeholders will have different responses and impacts based on market developments.\n\nThe initial event is the projected growth of the NUT midline carcinoma treatment market. The timeline should start from this point and branch out based on possible actions and reactions. The user provided an example with ECB's response to inflation, so I need to structure similar branches here.\n\nPlausibility is crucial. For example, increased R&D investment leading to breakthroughs in targeted therapies is a logical step. Then, regulatory approvals would follow, which in turn affect market dynamics. But I also need to consider possible setbacks, like clinical trial failures, which are common in pharma.\n\nNovelty requires thinking beyond the obvious. Maybe a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund investing in APAC biotech, as in the example. Or cross-border partnerships that aren't immediately obvious. Also, considering how geopolitical factors might influence market dynamics, like US-China trade tensions affecting supply chains for drug components.\n\nElaboration means each node should be specific. Instead of just saying \"new drug approved,\" specify the drug class, like BET inhibitors, and the companies involved. Mentioning specific regions and their strategies, like India's generic production, adds detail.\n\nActionable insights could involve investment opportunities. For example, if targeted therapies are growing, investing in companies developing BET inhibitors. Or shorting companies reliant on chemotherapy if they're losing market share. Also, looking at medical device companies that support oral administration methods.\n\nNow, structuring the timeline. The initial event is the market growth projection. From there, possible branches could be successful R&D leading to new treatments, or clinical trial failures. Each of these leads to further developments. For example, successful trials might lead to accelerated FDA approvals, which then impact market shares and regional expansions.\n\nAnother branch could be regulatory changes or geopolitical issues affecting supply chains. For instance, US-China tensions impacting API production, leading to companies diversifying their supply chains to India or Southeast Asia.\n\nIncluding mergers and acquisitions as key players try to consolidate their positions. Also, considering patient advocacy groups pushing for faster approvals, which could influence regulatory bodies.\n\nEach node should have a clear description, date range, and children nodes that branch out. The challenge is to make sure each path is plausible and detailed, while also introducing creative elements that aren't just linear projections.\n\nFor example, after a successful Phase III trial, a company might face production bottlenecks, leading them to partner with CDMOs in Asia. This could then affect regional market growth and create investment opportunities in those CDMOs.\n\nAnother angle is the shift from intravenous to oral administration. Companies investing in oral formulations might partner with drug delivery tech firms, creating opportunities in that niche sector.\n\nAlso, considering the impact of AI in drug discovery for rare cancers, which could accelerate R&D timelines and create partnerships between pharma and tech companies.\n\nPotential risks include regulatory hurdles, even after successful trials, which could delay market entry. Or pricing pressures from governments, especially in regions like Europe with cost containment policies.\n\nIn the Asia Pacific region, growth is driven by healthcare investments. Maybe countries like China fast-tracking approvals to capture market share, leading to competitive dynamics with Western companies.\n\nEach of these points needs to be structured into the timeline with appropriate branching, ensuring that each step logically follows and provides actionable insights for investment strategies.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"NUT Midline Carcinoma Market Growth Projection (2023-2034)\",\n  \"description\": \"Market projected to grow from $21.88B to $79.38B at 12.43% CAGR.
