  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a high-quality timeline based on the given scenario about the global brain ischemia market. The scenario provides data on market growth, key players, segments, and regional trends. The output needs to be a JSON structure with branches that meet the criteria for plausibility, novelty, elaboration, and actionable insights.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main actors and stakeholders. The key players are pharmaceutical companies like Abbott, J&J, Boehringer Ingelheim, etc. There are also medical device companies like Boston Scientific and Edwards Lifesciences. Then there are regional factors, especially in Asia-Pacific where the market is growing fastest. Other stakeholders include healthcare providers (hospitals, clinics), regulatory bodies, and maybe even insurance companies.\n\nThe market is driven by increasing incidence of strokes and related conditions, aging populations, and technological advancements in treatments like angioplasty and thrombectomy devices. The report mentions growth in Asia-Pacific due to economic growth and medical advancements.\n\nNow, to create a timeline, I need to think about possible future events based on these drivers. Let's start with the initial event: the market report's release and its projections. From there, possible branches could involve regulatory changes, technological breakthroughs, market entry strategies, or regional developments.\n\nPlausibility is key. For example, if a new drug is approved, that's a plausible event. If a company invests in R&D, leading to a breakthrough, that's another. In Asia-Pacific, maybe governments start funding stroke awareness campaigns, which would increase demand.\n\nNovelty: Think about unexpected alliances, like tech companies entering the medical device space. Or maybe a supply chain issue with rare materials affecting device manufacturing. Another angle could be insurance companies changing reimbursement policies, affecting adoption rates.\n\nElaboration: Each node should be specific. Instead of \"new treatment developed,\" specify the type, like \"AI-driven thrombectomy devices.\" Mention specific companies and regions. For actionable insights, identify which stocks or sectors would benefit or suffer from each development. For example, if a company gets FDA approval, their competitors might lose market share, so shorting them could be an option.\n\nLet's structure the timeline. The initial event is the market report predicting growth. Then, possible branches could be:\n\n1. Regulatory Approvals: FDA fast-tracks a new drug, leading to increased revenue for that company.\n2. Technological Innovations: A breakthrough in neuroprotective drugs by a key player.\n3. Asia-Pacific Expansion: Companies partner with local firms in APAC to capitalize on growth.\n4. Supply Chain Issues: Disruption in materials for medical devices affecting production.\n5. Reimbursement Policies: Changes in insurance coverage affecting treatment adoption.\n\nEach of these branches can have sub-branches. For example, under regulatory approvals, if the FDA approves a new drug, competitors might respond by accelerating their own R&D, leading to a surge in biotech investments. Alternatively, if there's a delay in approval, the company's stock might drop.\n\nUnder Asia-Pacific expansion, if a company in India partners with a global player, they might capture a larger market share, affecting competitors. This could lead to increased M&A activity in the region.\n\nFor supply chain issues, if there's a shortage of a specific component used in thrombectomy devices, companies might seek alternative suppliers or innovate new materials, impacting costs and stock prices.\n\nEach node should include dates, specific actions, and the resulting market impact. Also, actionable investment ideas like going long on certain stocks, shorting others, or investing in related sectors like medical equipment manufacturers.\n\nNeed to ensure that each path is plausible. For example, a regulatory change in the U.S. affecting drug prices is plausible given current political debates. Similarly, technological collaborations between AI firms and medical device companies are emerging trends.\n\nCheck for feedback loops. For instance, a successful new treatment increases demand, leading to more R&D investment, which further accelerates innovation. Conversely, a treatment failure could lead to stricter regulations, slowing down the market.\n\nFinally, ensure the JSON structure is correctly formatted with unique IDs, titles, descriptions, and children arrays. Each node should have enough detail to stand alone as an insight and guide investment decisions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"2023 Brain Ischemia Market Report Release (USD 839M valuation, 7.6% CAGR projected)\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"APAC Market Acceleration\",\n      \"date_range\": \"2024-2025\",\n      \"description\": \"China/India launch national stroke prevention programs with subsidies for thrombectomy devices.
