Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this scenario about the porcine vaccine market. The user wants a high-quality timeline with plausible, novel, and actionable branches. Let me start by understanding the key elements here.\n\nFirst, the market is growing due to factors like increasing porcine diseases, R&D expenditure, and animal healthcare spending. The main players are big pharma companies like Zoetis, Merck, Boehringer Ingelheim, etc. The market is segmented by product type and region, with North America, Europe, Asia, and RoW. The demand for pork and gelatin is a key driver.\n\nNow, the user wants a timeline that explores possible evolutions of this market. I need to consider stakeholders: vaccine manufacturers, pork producers, governments, regulatory bodies, maybe even activists. Possible events could be disease outbreaks, regulatory changes, technological advancements, mergers, or supply chain issues.\n\nLet me think about plausible branches. One obvious path is continued growth, but that's too linear. Need to find creative yet plausible twists. For example, a major disease outbreak could spike demand, but maybe also lead to overcapacity if not managed. Alternatively, a breakthrough in vaccine tech (like mRNA) could disrupt traditional players. Regulatory changes in key regions like China or the EU could affect market dynamics.\n\nAnother angle: environmental or ethical concerns. If there's a shift towards lab-grown meat or plant-based proteins, pork demand might drop, affecting the vaccine market. But that's a longer-term possibility. Alternatively, a zoonotic disease outbreak linked to pigs could lead to culling and vaccine mandates, boosting the market but also increasing scrutiny.\n\nSupply chain issues for raw materials, like gelatin (which comes from pigs), could create a feedback loop. If gelatin demand is driving vaccine growth, but a disease reduces pig populations, gelatin becomes scarce, prices rise, which might affect both the pork industry and vaccine production (since some vaccines use gelatin as a stabilizer). That's a potential hidden loop.\n\nLooking at regions: Asia, especially China, is a major pork consumer. Any disease outbreak there (like another African Swine Fever wave) could lead to massive vaccination drives. But if local manufacturers in China start dominating, that could squeeze Western companies. Geopolitical tensions might lead to protectionist policies, favoring domestic vendors.\n\nTechnological competition: startups using AI for vaccine development might speed up R&D, challenging established players. Or CRISPR-based vaccines could emerge, offering longer immunity. This could lead to partnerships or acquisitions.\n\nNow, considering the criteria:\n\nPlausibility: Each branch should be backed by current trends. For example, mRNA tech is already being explored in animal vaccines. African Swine Fever is a real concern in Asia.\n\nNovelty: The gelatin supply chain feedback loop is a less obvious angle. Also, lab-grown meat impact on pork demand is a creative risk that's emerging.\n\nElaboration: Each node should have specific actions, like \"China mandates ASF vaccination\" leading to specific regional impacts and company strategies.\n\nActionable: Investors could go long on companies investing in mRNA tech, short those reliant on traditional methods. Or invest in Asian vaccine manufacturers if local policies favor them.\n\nLet me structure the timeline starting with the initial event of market growth. Then branch into possible disease outbreaks, tech disruptions, regulatory changes, and alternative protein impacts. Each branch needs to have consequences and possible investment actions.\n\nFor example:\n\nInitial Event: Market growth forecast. Then:\n\nBranch 1: ASF outbreak in Asia (plausible given history). This leads to increased vaccination mandates. Companies like Zoetis expand in Asia, but local players like China Animal Husbandry Group get government contracts. Short Western firms if they're excluded.\n\nBranch 2: mRNA vaccine breakthrough. Zoetis partners with BioNTech, acquires startups. Traditional intramuscular vaccines decline. Long companies with mRNA IP.\n\nBranch 3: Gelatin shortage due to disease culling. Prices rise, vaccine costs increase. Companies switch to alternatives, invest in synthetic biology. Short gelatin-dependent vaccine makers.\n\nBranch 4: Lab-grown meat gains traction. Pork demand drops, vaccine market growth slows. Shift investments to alt-protein, short pork producers.\n\nEach of these needs to be fleshed out with dates, specific actors, and investment implications. Also, consider feedback loops. For example, a successful vaccine rollout might stabilize pork supply, reducing gelatin prices, which affects vaccine costs.\n\nNeed to ensure that each node is detailed, with sector impacts and actionable trades. Avoid generic terms. Instead of \"market reacts,\" specify which sectors or companies are affected and how.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Porcine Vaccine Market Growth (2023-2028)\",\n  \"description\": \"Market projected to grow by $709.6M at 6.4% CAGR driven by disease prevalence, R&D spend, and pork/gelatin demand\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"African Swine Fever (ASF) Resurgence in China\",\n      \"date_range\": \"2024-Q2\",\n      \"description\": \"New ASF variant evades existing vaccines; 20% pork production loss in Sichuan province.
