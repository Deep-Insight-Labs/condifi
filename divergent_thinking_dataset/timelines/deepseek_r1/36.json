Adjusted EPS of $1.55 and revenue of $9.71 billion surpassed estimates of $1.50 and $9.44 billion respectively. The smoke-free portion of the business now accounts for 40% of overall revenue and 42% of gross profit. \n\nKey metrics for Q4 2024 include: \n- Adjusted EPS: $1.55 (up 14% from Q4 2023)\n- Revenue: $9.71 billion (up 7.3% from Q4 2023)\n- Adjusted operating income: $3.52 billion (up 15.3% from Q4 2023)\n- Smoke-free revenue: $3.9 billion (up 9.2% from Q4 2023)\n- Combustibles revenue: $5.8 billion (up 6% from Q4 2023)\n\nThe company's focus on smoke-free growth is underscored by its investment in Swedish Match and expansion of the ZYN brand. Revenue from smoke-free products grew by 40% in Q4 2024. Heated Tobacco Units (HTUs) shipments rose by 5.1% and cigarette shipments increased marginally by 1.1%.\n\nRegulatory successes, such as the U.S. FDA authorization of ZYN nicotine pouches and IQOS devices, are critical in building credibility for smoke-free alternatives. The company's geographic expansion also played a pivotal role, with adjusted International Market Share (IMS) growing significantly in Japan and Europe.\n\nPhilip Morris still faces challenges such as ongoing litigation and related impairment charges. The company has set an optimistic outlook for 2025, projecting an adjusted EPS between $7.04 and $7.17, representing an increase of up to 9.1% in adjusted EPS from 2024.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this scenario. Philip Morris International (PMI) has reported strong Q4 2024 earnings, with smoke-free products now making up a significant portion of their revenue. The key here is to map out the possible future developments based on this event, considering various stakeholders and plausible responses.\n\nFirst, the main actors and stakeholders. PMI's management is pushing smoke-free products, so their strategy is crucial. Investors and analysts are reacting to the earnings beat and future guidance. Regulatory bodies like the FDA are important because they've approved products like ZYN and IQOS, which affects PMI's credibility. Competitors like Altria and BAT would respond to PMI's success. Consumers, especially in markets like Japan and Europe, are adopting smoke-free alternatives. Then there are public health groups and litigants who might challenge PMI's new products.\n\nStarting with the initial event: PMI's Q4 earnings beat and smoke-free growth. The immediate reaction might be a stock price surge. Then, looking at possible branches. One path is accelerated regulatory approvals, which could lead to faster market penetration. Another is competitors responding, maybe through M&A or innovation. There's also the risk of litigation or regulatory pushback, which could slow growth.\n\nFor each branch, I need to think about plausibility. For example, if PMI gets more FDA approvals, that's plausible given their recent success. Competitors might acquire smaller firms to catch up, which makes sense. On the flip side, public health groups might lobby for stricter regulations, leading to delays. Litigation could resurface, affecting investor sentiment.\n\nThen, considering novelty. Maybe PMI's success in smoke-free products could push them into adjacent markets like cannabis or wellness, which is a creative expansion. Another angle is geopolitical factors, like trade tensions affecting supply chains for their products. Also, if smoke-free adoption accelerates, it might lead to unexpected partnerships with tech companies for distribution.\n\nElaboration is key. Each node should have specific actions. For example, if PMI expands into cannabis, they might partner with existing players, affecting stock prices of those companies. Or, if the EU imposes stricter regulations, PMI might shift focus to emerging markets, impacting revenue streams there.\n\nActionable insights would involve identifying sectors or assets to invest in. For instance, long PMI stock if regulatory approvals continue, short competitors if they lag. Or, investing in cannabis ETFs if PMI moves into that space. Also, monitoring supply chain companies for heated tobacco units could present opportunities.\n\nNow, structuring this into a timeline with branches. The initial event is the earnings report. Then, possible immediate reactions: stock up, competitors respond, regulatory actions, etc. Each of these leads to further branches. For example, competitors might either innovate or acquire. Regulatory paths could be more lenient or restrictive. Each of those has subsequent effects on PMI's strategy, market share, and financials.\n\nNeed to ensure each node is detailed. Instead of just \"regulatory approval,\" specify which regions and products. Instead of \"competitors respond,\" name specific companies and actions. Also, consider time frames: short-term (next quarter), medium-term (6-12 months), long-term (1-2 years).\n\nPotential risks to consider: litigation costs, regulatory setbacks, market saturation in smoke-free products, or consumer backlash. Each of these could create branches where PMI's growth slows, affecting their EPS projections.\n\nAlso, macroeconomic factors: if there's a recession, consumers might revert to cheaper combustible products, impacting PMI's revenue mix. Or, conversely, health trends accelerating the shift to smoke-free despite economic conditions.\n\nIn terms of investment actions, if PMI's smoke-free products gain more market share, suppliers of components for IQOS or ZYN could benefit. Conversely, traditional tobacco suppliers might face decline. Also, shorting companies slow to adapt, like certain competitors, could be a play.\n\nNeed to check for historical analogs. Similar to when tech companies shifted from hardware to software, PMI's pivot might disrupt the tobacco industry. Regulatory approvals akin to pharmaceutical drug approvals, where speed can significantly impact market position.\n\nFinally, ensuring the timeline has high elaboration, each node is specific, and paths are creative but plausible. For example, a hidden risk might be over-reliance on a single product like ZYN, which if faces a recall or issue, could tank PMI's growth. Or, unexpected partnerships, like with tech firms for distribution channels.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"PMI Q4 Earnings Beat & Smoke-Free Milestone\",\n  \"description\": \"PMI reports smoke-free products now 40% of revenue (42% gross profit), driven by ZYN/IQOS growth and FDA approvals. 2025 EPS guidance implies 9.1% growth.\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"Accelerated Regulatory Greenlights\",\n      \"date_range\": \"Q1-Q2 2025\",\n      \"description\": \"FDA fast-tracks PMI's new ZYN variants (caffeine blends) and IQOS 4.0.
