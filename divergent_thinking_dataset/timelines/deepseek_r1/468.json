Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

A forward stock split reduces a company's share price, making it more affordable for everyday investors. Historically, companies that have completed forward stock splits have outperformed the market, with an average return of 25.4% in the 12 months following the announcement.\n\nMeta Platforms, with 72% institutional ownership, is a prime candidate for a stock-split announcement. The company's social media assets, including Facebook and Instagram, generate 98% of its revenue from advertising. Meta's AI and metaverse initiatives are also expected to drive growth. The company has a cash-rich balance sheet, with close to $71 billion in cash and generates an average of over $21 billion in net operating cash per quarter.\n\nNetflix, which last split its stock in 2015, is another potential candidate for a stock-split announcement. The company has a clear competitive advantage in the streaming market, with a large and loyal user base. Netflix has generated over $7.1 billion in free cash flow over the trailing year and has maintained strong subscription pricing power. A high-magnitude forward stock split could take attention away from Netflix's premium valuation, which is 37 times forward-year cash flow and 35 times forward-year earnings.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a high-quality timeline based on the scenario where Meta and Netflix announce stock splits in 2025. The output needs to be in JSON, following the example structure with branches for different possibilities. The criteria are plausibility, novelty, elaboration, and actionable insights.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key actors and stakeholders. For Meta and Netflix, the main players would be retail investors, institutional investors, competitors, regulators (like the SEC), and possibly the broader market indices. Also, considering the sectors they operate in—tech, streaming, advertising, AI, metaverse.\n\nStarting with the initial event: both companies announce stock splits. The immediate effects could be increased retail participation due to lower share prices. But I need to think about possible branches. For each company, the outcomes might differ based on their specific situations.\n\nMeta has a high institutional ownership (72%), so a stock split might attract more retail investors, but institutions might adjust their holdings. Also, Meta's heavy reliance on AI and metaverse investments—how does the stock split affect their ability to fund these? Maybe the increased liquidity could lead to more capital allocation towards these projects. But if the market perceives the split as a gimmick, there might be skepticism.\n\nNetflix, on the other hand, has a high valuation. Their split might be seen as a way to distract from premium multiples. If the split, maybe retail investors drive the price up, but if the underlying fundamentals (like subscriber growth) don't support it, there could be a correction. Also, competitors like Disney+ or Amazon Prime might respond with their own strategies.\n\nPossible branches for each company:\n\n1. Meta's split leads to retail surge, boosting stock short-term. Then, either:\n   a. Institutions rebalance, causing volatility.\n   b. Meta uses the increased stock price to issue more shares for acquisitions, accelerating metaverse projects.\n   c. Regulatory scrutiny if the split is seen as market manipulation.\n\n2. Netflix's split diverts attention from valuation. Then:\n   a. Retail buying pushes P/E higher, but if earnings don't keep up, a pullback.\n   b. Competitors respond with content investments or pricing changes.\n   c. If the market shifts (e.g., ad-supported tiers gain traction, affecting Netflix's model).\n\nAlso, broader market conditions. If the splits happen during a bull market, the effect might be amplified. If during a downturn, the impact could be muted or even negative.\n\nAnother angle: stock splits often lead to inclusion in indices or ETFs that have price thresholds, which could drive more institutional buying. For example, Meta might enter more retail-focused ETFs, increasing demand.\n\nBut need to consider possible negative paths. What if the splits don't lead to the expected retail influx? Maybe if the market is saturated with splits, the effect diminishes. Or if there's a regulatory change affecting stock splits.\n\nAlso, considering historical analogs. Companies like Apple and Tesla had splits followed by rallies, but not always sustained. Need to model both bullish and bearish scenarios.\n\nFor actionable insights: long on companies that supply digital advertising (if Meta's stock rise boosts ad spend), short on traditional media if Netflix gains more dominance. Alternatively, pairs trades between Meta/Netflix and competitors.\n\nNow, structuring this into a timeline with branches. The initial node is the stock split announcements. Then, possible immediate reactions, followed by secondary effects, and so on.\n\nEach node needs to be specific. For example, \"Retail buying surge leads to 20% price increase in 3 months\" with a date range. Then, under that, possible next steps like institutional rebalancing or SEC scrutiny.\n\nAlso, considering feedback loops. Higher stock prices might lead to more employee stock options being exercised, affecting company cash flow. Or increased market cap leading to more M&A activity.\n\nNeed to ensure each path is plausible. For example, SEC scrutiny is plausible if there's a trend of splits without fundamental reasons. Or competitors' responses based on industry trends.\n\nNovelty: Maybe considering that a surge in retail investment could lead to unexpected market structure changes, like increased options trading affecting volatility. Or Meta using the split to spin off a metaverse subsidiary.\n\nElaboration: Each node should have specific actions, like \"Meta's R&D budget increases by 15% for AI projects funded by equity issuance.\" Or \"Netflix partners with telecoms to bundle services, leveraging higher stock valuation.\"\n\nActionable: Suggest sectors to invest in, like semiconductor companies supplying AI chips if Meta invests more, or shorting cable companies if streaming gains more share.\n\nPutting this all together in JSON format, with branches for each possibility, ensuring high quality in all criteria.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Meta/Netflix Announce 2025 Stock Splits\",\n  \"description\": \"Meta (10:1) and Netflix (7:1) announce high-magnitude splits to attract retail investors and reset perception of premium valuations\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"Retail Frenzy Phase (0-3 Months)\",\n      \"date_range\": \"Q1 2025\",\n      \"description\": \"Robinhood/Webull users drive 20%+ price surge;
