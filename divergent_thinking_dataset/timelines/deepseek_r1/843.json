If a recession is coming, three stocks to own are Dominion Energy, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, and Walmart. \n\nDominion Energy is a utility stock that provides electricity and natural gas to 4 million customers in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. It has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.5 and is up 1.34% so far in 2025. The company's shares are resilient and should be less impacted by tariffs. \n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals is a biotech stock that markets the only approved therapies for cystic fibrosis and has a non-opioid pain therapy, Journavx, that is effective and non-addictive. The company's pipeline features four phase 3 programs, including a potential cure for severe type 1 diabetes. Vertex's shares are up 0.95% so far in 2025. \n\nWalmart is the world's largest retailer and discount retailer, with a \"everyday low prices\" strategy that should continue to attract customers during a recession. The company pays a quarterly dividend and has a 52-year track record of dividend increases. Walmart's shares trade at 33.6 times forward earnings.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this scenario. The user wants a high-quality timeline based on the given data about CFOs' recession expectations and the three recommended stocks. The key points are the high probability of a recession in 2025, Trump's tariffs causing inflation, and the three stocks to own. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the main actors and stakeholders. The primary actors here are the U.S. government (especially Trump's administration), CFOs, investors, the Federal Reserve, corporations (like Dominion, Vertex, Walmart), consumers. Other stakeholders might include international trade partners, other sectors affected by tariffs, and possibly foreign governments reacting to U.S. policies.\n\nStarting with the initial event: 60% of CFOs expect a recession in late 2025, 15% next year, and 90% think Trump's tariffs will cause inflation. The immediate reaction would be market positioning towards defensive stocks like utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples. So Dominion, Vertex, and Walmart would see inflows.\n\nNext, possible branches. The first major branch is whether the Fed responds to the inflation caused by tariffs. If they hike rates (T1A1), that could accelerate recession risks. Alternatively, if they hold rates to avoid worsening the recession (T1A2), inflation might persist. \n\nUnder Fed rate hikes (T1A1), we could see a stronger dollar, which would hurt exporters but benefit importers. However, higher rates might lead to a faster economic slowdown. This could lead to political pressure on Trump to adjust tariffs (T2A1), maybe exemptions for certain industries. If that happens, sectors like autos or electronics might get relief, reducing input costs. But if exemptions aren't granted (T2A2), inflation remains high, leading to consumer spending shifts towards discount retailers like Walmart. \n\nUnder the Fed holding rates (T1A2), inflation stays high, leading to wage-price spirals. This could cause consumers to prioritize essentials, benefiting Walmart. Vertex's non-opioid pain drug might see increased demand as healthcare remains a priority. Dominion's stable returns would attract investors seeking safety. \n\nAnother branch could be the actual onset of the recession. If it hits in late 2025 as expected (T3A1), defensive stocks outperform. But if the recession is delayed (T3A2), maybe due to Fed actions or fiscal stimulus, investors might rotate back to cyclicals, causing a sell-off in defensive sectors. However, Vertex's pipeline (like diabetes cure) could still attract growth investors even in a delayed recession.\n\nI need to ensure each node is specific. For example, under Dominion's performance, mention their regulatory environment and infrastructure investments. For Vertex, highlight their drug pipeline phases and potential market expansions. For Walmart, discuss private label expansion and e-commerce growth against competitors like Amazon.\n\nActionable points: Short sectors vulnerable to tariffs and rate hikes (e.g., consumer discretionary, industrials). Long utilities, healthcare, consumer staples. Maybe pairs trades like long Walmart vs. short higher-end retailers. Also, consider inflation-protected securities if inflation persists.\n\nCheck for plausibility. Fed's response to inflation from tariffs is a classic dilemma. Historical analogs like 1970s stagflation or 2018 trade wars. The bifurcation in market performance between defensive and cyclical sectors is well-documented during recessions.\n\nNovelty: Maybe considering how biotech like Vertex could be both defensive and growth, especially with breakthrough therapies. Also, the interplay between tariff exemptions and specific supply chain recoveries. Another angle is how infrastructure spending (if any) might affect Dominion's growth beyond being a utility.\n\nElaboration: Each node should have specific mechanisms. For example, Vertex's type 1 diabetes cure entering phase 3 could lead to partnerships or stock upside. Walmart's dividend track record and private label expansion are concrete factors.\n\nPutting it all together in the JSON structure, starting with the initial event, then branching into Fed actions, subsequent market and policy responses, leading to different outcomes for each stock and broader market implications. Ensure each node has enough detail and links to investment actions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"60% of CFOs forecast 2025 U.S. recession; 90% link Trump tariffs to inflation.
