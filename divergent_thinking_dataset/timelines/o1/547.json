Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”).

According to estimates, AI technology's electricity consumption could increase from 8 terawatt-hours in 2024 to 652 terawatt-hours by 2030. Nuclear power could help solve this challenge as it is efficient and clean. \n\nThree top nuclear stocks to consider are: \n\n1. Cameco, a leading uranium producer with a 18% global uranium supply share, poised for long-term growth as big technology companies and countries consider nuclear power to meet energy needs while reducing carbon emissions. Analysts estimate the company's revenue will hit $2.3 billion in 2025. Cameco's business has picked up over the past couple of years.\n\n2. Southern Company, one of the largest energy companies in the US, with a core business in electricity generation and electric and natural gas utilities serving over 9 million customers. The company has invested heavily in nuclear energy and offers a 3.5% dividend yield. It's not the cheapest utility, but it's not unbearable for long-term investors.\n\n3. GE Vernova, a diversified clean energy technology company that deals in clean power generation, grid electrification, and wind and gas turbines. Its power generation business includes nuclear, providing reactors, fuel, services, and steam turbines for electricity generation. Management anticipates high single-digit revenue growth through 2028 and is investing $5 billion cumulatively in research and development to drive long-term growth.\n\nThe companies are exposed to the growth in nuclear energy, which is expected to increase by 2.5 times its current capacity by 2050. Geopolitical tensions, including the US ban on uranium imports from Russia, could further boost business for Western producers like Cameco.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
