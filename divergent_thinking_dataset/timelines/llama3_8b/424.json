  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

Analyst Jason Moser notes that this is not uncommon at the end of the year, but there is uncertainty about the new administration's policies and interest rate changes.\n\nConsumer credit card debt and delinquencies are a concern, with $46 billion in seriously delinquent balances written off in the first nine months of 2024, a 50% increase from the previous year. This may impact discretionary spending, particularly among lower-income earners who have little to no savings.\n\nRetailers may be affected by this trend, with companies like Target and Walmart potentially seeing a decline in sales. However, companies like Lululemon, which caters to higher-income earners, may fare better.\n\nAlphabet (Google) has announced its agenda for 2025, focusing on AI, Gemini, and Project Mariner. Google is exploring various approaches to AI, including generative AI, and is testing and learning from its users. This may lead to new revenue streams and opportunities for the company.\n\nJason Moser's resolutions for 2025 include minimizing selling and introducing new companies to his portfolio, as well as being a better person and approaching each day with a positive perspective. Dylan Lewis's resolutions include establishing a daily routine and structure to improve his productivity and positivity.\n\nKey financial information:\n\n* S&P 500 down 2% since Christmas\n* $46 billion in seriously delinquent credit card balances written off in the first nine months of 2024\n* Credit card debt in the US is over $1.1 trillion\n* Alphabet (Google) has announced its focus on AI, Gemini, and Project Mariner for 2025\n\nEconomic information:\n\n* Consumer credit card debt and delinquencies are a concern\n* Discretionary spending may be impacted by these trends\n* Retailers may be affected by changes in consumer behavior\n\nPolitical information:\n\n* The new administration's policies and interest rate changes are uncertain\n* The impact of these changes on the economy and consumer spending is unclear\n\nRelevant to TGT (Target Corporation):\n\n* Target may be affected by changes in consumer behavior and discretionary spending\n* The company's sales may decline if lower-income earners reduce their spending\n* Target's focus on value and affordability may help it to maintain sales in a challenging market.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
