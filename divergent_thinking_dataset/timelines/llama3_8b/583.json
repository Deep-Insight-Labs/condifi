Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

AI agents can automate simple tasks and follow directions. Three stocks that allow customers to utilize AI agents today are Microsoft, Salesforce, and ServiceNow.\n\nMicrosoft, a $3 trillion company, has launched its AI assistant Copilot and promises users can create their own agents through Copilot Studio. The company's Office applications are used by businesses worldwide, providing a huge opportunity for upselling. Microsoft's AI business is expected to surpass $10 billion in annual revenue, with CEO Satya Nadella predicting it will be the quickest to hit this milestone. Microsoft's stock trades at 35 times trailing earnings.\n\nSalesforce's Agentforce can provide support to employees and customers, and users can create their own agents with a low-code builder or use pre-built agents. The company's sales haven't been taking off, but AI agents could unlock a promising opportunity. Salesforce's stock trades at over 50 times earnings, but this multiple comes down to 29 when looking at estimates for next year's profits.\n\nServiceNow, a tech company that helps businesses automate processes, sees AI agents as a natural extension of its Now platform. CEO Bill McDermott believes AI represents a generational technology shift. ServiceNow has been growing at over 20% and trades at 64 times next year's estimated earnings. If the opportunity in AI agents proves to be a big catalyst, the stock can still be a good buy despite its high price tag.\n\nKey financial information:\n\n- Microsoft: $3 trillion valuation, 35 times trailing earnings\n- Salesforce: over 50 times earnings, 29 times next year's profits\n- ServiceNow: 64 times next year's estimated earnings, over 20% growth rate\n\nKey economic and political information:\n\n- AI agents are seen as a key trend in 2024\n- AI represents a promising growth opportunity for Microsoft, Salesforce, and ServiceNow\n- The mandate to put AI to work for people represents a generational technology shift, according to ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
