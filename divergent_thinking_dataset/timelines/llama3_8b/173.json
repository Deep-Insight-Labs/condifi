  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The market is driven by the increasing adoption of IoT devices, 5G networks, and smart infrastructure, which require efficient and reliable power and data transmission. \n\nKey players in the market include Broadcom, Microsemi, Marvell Technology, Texas Instruments, Linear Technology (now part of Analog Devices), Maxim Integrated, ON Semiconductor, STMicroelectronics, Silicon Labs, Microchip Technology, Qualcomm Atheros, Realtek Semiconductor, ASIX Electronics, Delta Electronics, and Sigma Designs.\n\nThe market is segmented by type, standard, device, and end-use. In 2023, PoE Powered Devices (PD) chipsets held a dominant 53.8% market share, driven by the widespread adoption of network cameras, VoIP phones, LED lighting, and wireless access points powered by Wireline PoE technology. PoE Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) chipsets are expected to witness the highest CAGR from 2024 to 2032, driven by the growing industrial automation, 5G networks, and smart city initiatives.\n\nThe 802.3at (PoE+) standard dominated the PoE chipset market with a 47.2% share in 2023, driven by its widespread use in VoIP phones, security cameras, wireless access points, and LED lighting. The IEEE 802.3bt standard is expected to register the highest CAGR from 2024 to 2032, driven by demand for higher power delivery (up to 100W).\n\nRegional analysis shows that North America held a dominant 36.9% market share in 2023, driven by the widespread adoption of smart infrastructure, catalyst equipment, and advanced networking solutions. Asia Pacific is expected to witness the highest CAGR from 2024 to 2032, due to increasing urbanization, industrialization, and several smart city initiatives.\n\nRecent developments include the Ethernet Alliance emphasizing the importance of PoE certification in ensuring interoperability and preventing costly recalls, and a Raspberry Pi 500 teardown uncovering space for an M.2 SSD and Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) support, hinting at potential future variants with enhanced storage and power options.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
