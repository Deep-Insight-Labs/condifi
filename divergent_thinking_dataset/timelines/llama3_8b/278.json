  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

(NASDAQ: REGN) is facing a securities fraud class action lawsuit after its shares plummeted $84.59 on October 31, 2024, wiping out approximately $9 billion in market value. The class action is focused on the company's compliance with applicable rules and regulations concerning its Medicare reimbursement claims, particularly with respect to its EYLEA product. \n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Regeneron made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that it paid credit card fees to distributors on the condition that they did not charge EYLEA customers more to use a credit card, thereby subsidizing prices and providing a competitive advantage. The company also allegedly overstated reported EYLEA sales and violated the False Claims Act by failing to report credit card fees as price concessions.\n\nOn April 10, 2024, the Department of Justice sued Regeneron for False Claims Act violations, alleging that the company fraudulently inflated Medicare reimbursement rates for EYLEA by submitting false reports to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The DOJ further alleged that Regeneron marketed EYLEA's stable ASP as a competitive advantage for retina practices.\n\nRegeneron's financial results for Q3 2024 revealed disappointing U.S. net sales for its EYLEA and EYLEA HD products, which drove the price of Regeneron shares down over 9% on October 31, 2024. The company blamed \"the lower net selling price compared to the third quarter of 2023\" and \"anti-VEGF category pricing pressure\" for the decline in sales.\n\nThe lead plaintiff deadline for the class action is March 10, 2025, and investors who purchased Regeneron shares and suffered substantial losses are urged to submit their losses now. Whistleblowers with non-public information regarding Regeneron may also consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program, which offers rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
