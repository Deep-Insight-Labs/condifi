Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The 10-year Treasury yield is at 4.50% and the two-year yield is at 4.20%. The CME Group's FedWatch tool indicates an 80% probability that the Federal Open Market Committee will maintain current interest rates in March 2025. \n\nApple Inc. AAPL will report its first-quarter earnings after the market closes today, with analysts expecting quarterly earnings of $2.35 per share on revenue of $124.13 billion. The company's shares were down 0.14% in the premarket.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up 2.91% year-to-date, and higher January tends to suggest better returns for the final 11 months of the year. The Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Russell 2000 were trading higher, with the Russell 2000 leading the gains at 0.99%.\n\nUnited Parcel Service Inc. UPS was up 1.62% ahead of its earnings, while Tesla Inc. TSLA was up 1.78% despite weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and sales results. Meta Platforms Inc. META was up 2.23% after reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales results.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. CAT was up 0.70% ahead of its earnings, while Microsoft Corp. MSFT was down 3.99% as its cloud revenue missed estimates. IBM Corp. IBM was up 7.60% as it beat its revenue and earnings estimates for the fourth quarter.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit widened to a record $122.11 billion in December, while wholesale inventories fell 0.5%. The tech, real estate, and healthcare sectors dragged the S&P 500 lower, though consumer staples and communication services gained.\n\nThe GDP data for the first quarter and the initial jobless claims data till Jan. 25 will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, while December's pending home sales will be out at 10:00 a.m., ET.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
