Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The market is driven by rising incidences of eye-related conditions, an aging global population, and lifestyle changes that increase susceptibility to these conditions. A strong pipeline of new ophthalmic drugs is also bolstering market expansion, with pharmaceutical companies investing in R&D to introduce enhanced and novel treatments.\n\nKey factors driving the market include technological advancements, increasing prevalence of diabetes, and the presence of a strong emerging pipeline of drugs. However, the market is restrained by factors such as lack of health insurance in developing countries, lack of awareness regarding available treatment options, side effects of drugs, patent expiry of blockbuster drugs, and intensified competition in the crowded ophthalmic drugs market.\n\nLeading companies in the ophthalmic drugs market include AbbVie, Alcon, Alimera Sciences, Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Bausch + Lomb, Bayer, Breye Therapeutics ApS, EyeBio, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Johnson & Johnson Services, Nicox, Novaliq, Novartis, Pfizer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Santen Pharmaceutical Co., SpliceBio, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, and Viatris.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals is one of the leading companies in the ophthalmic drugs market, with a focus on developing innovative treatments for eye diseases. The company's pipeline includes several promising drugs, including pegcetacoplan, which was approved by the FDA for geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration.\n\nHowever, pegcetacoplan has raised safety concerns due to instances of intraocular inflammation, which has highlighted the importance of continuous monitoring and real-world safety analysis of the drug. This has also underscored the need for a comprehensive strategy to address drug-related side effects in the ophthalmic drugs market, particularly in developing countries.\n\nThe ophthalmic drugs market is expected to continue its growth trajectory in the coming years, driven by sustained innovation and continuous advancements in the field. The market is expected to reach $35 billion in 2025, with strong revenue growth through to 2035.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
