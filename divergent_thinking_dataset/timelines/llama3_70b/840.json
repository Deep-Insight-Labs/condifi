  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The company is expected to deliver long-term operating earnings-per-share growth of 5-7% and has a history of maintaining its dividend. Dominion Energy operates in three states with growing populations and has opportunities in data centers. The stock has pulled back due to Federal Reserve hints on interest rate cuts.\n\nPfizer (PFE) has a forward dividend yield of 6.5% and trades at a low price-to-earnings ratio of 8.9. The company has a strong lineup of new products and a promising late-stage pipeline. Pfizer's growth prospects are expected to be good despite losing patent exclusivity for several products.\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) has a forward dividend yield of 5.13% and a track record of 15 consecutive dividend increases. The company has returned to revenue and earnings growth and is poised for a turnaround story. UPS is focusing on higher-margin packages and has a goal of becoming the world's top healthcare logistics provider.\n[Output in JSON]\n",

growth prospects. The tree structure allows for the exploration of multiple scenarios, including interest rate cuts and hikes, and their effects on the companies' stock prices, dividend yields, and growth prospects.\n\nThe plausibility of each path is supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and historical analogs. The novelty of the nodes and paths is high, as they demonstrate expert-level creative reasoning and identify counterintuitive paths, rare risks, and hidden feedback loops.\n\nThe elaboration of the occurrences represented by the nodes is high, as each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. The paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity, providing truly investment-grade thinking.\n\nThe timeline is actionable, as it includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, and opportunities, such as investing in Dominion Energy's stock due to its attractive dividend yield, or buying Pfizer's stock due to its low price-to-earnings ratio and promising pipeline. The timeline also highlights potential risks, such as the impact of interest rate hikes on dividend stocks, and provides strategies for mitigating these risks, such as diversifying portfolios and focusing on operational efficiency.",
