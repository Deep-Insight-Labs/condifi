  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

Ares Capital, a business development company, offers a forward dividend yield of 1.18% and has delivered exceptional total returns over the long term. \n\nFour midstream energy leaders, including Enbridge, Energy Transfer, Enterprise Products Partners, and Williams Companies, could benefit from President-elect Trump's pledge to increase domestic oil and gas production. Enterprise Products Partners offers the highest forward dividend yield of 6.59% and has increased its distribution for 26 consecutive years.\n\nUtility stocks, such as Brookfield Infrastructure, Brookfield Renewable, Dominion Energy, and Evergy, typically pay attractive dividends. Dominion Energy, which serves customers in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, could extend its momentum in the new year due to the growth of data centers in Northern Virginia.\n\nBig pharma stocks, including AbbVie and Pfizer, have been longtime favorites for income investors. Pfizer's yield stands near the top of the list at 6.46%, but the company's share price has plunged more than 50% since late 2021. Pfizer has multiple new products on the market and a promising pipeline with 108 clinical programs.\n\nReal estate investment trusts (REITs), such as National Storage Affiliates Trust and Realty Income, offer highly attractive dividend yields. Realty Income is one of the best REITs on the market, with close to 15,500 properties in eight countries, and has increased its dividend for 30 consecutive years.\n\nRetailers, including Lowe's Companies and Target, are also Dividend Kings, with a history of increasing their dividend for at least 50 consecutive years. Target has increased its dividend for 52 consecutive years and has a strong digital channel and loyalty program.\n\nOther dividend stocks to buy and hold in 2025 include Honda Motor, PepsiCo, United Parcel Service, and Verizon Communications, which have solid businesses built for the long term and pay juicy dividends.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
