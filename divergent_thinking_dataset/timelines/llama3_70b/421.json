  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

Ares Capital, a business development company, offers a 8.65% forward dividend yield and has delivered exceptional total returns over the long term. \n\nPresident-elect Trump's pledge to increase domestic oil and gas production could boost companies that operate pipelines, such as Enbridge, Energy Transfer, Enterprise Products Partners, ExxonMobil, and Williams Companies. Enterprise Products Partners offers the highest forward dividend yield of 6.59% and has increased its distribution for 26 consecutive years.\n\nUtility stocks typically pay attractive dividends, with Brookfield Infrastructure, Brookfield Renewable, Dominion Energy, Evergy, and UGI offering forward dividend yields ranging from 4.32% to 6.14%. Dominion Energy's momentum could extend into the new year due to its presence in Northern Virginia, a global hotspot for data centers.\n\nBig pharma stocks, such as AbbVie and Pfizer, have been longtime favorites for income investors. Pfizer's yield stands near the top of the list at 6.46%, but its share price has plunged more than 50% since late 2021. The company has multiple new products on the market and a promising pipeline with 108 clinical programs.\n\nReal estate investment trusts (REITs) offer highly attractive dividend yields, with National Storage Affiliates Trust and Realty Income offering forward dividend yields of 6% and 5.96%, respectively. Realty Income is one of the best REITs on the market, with a 30-year dividend increase streak.\n\nRetailers Target and Lowe's Companies are both Dividend Kings, with Target increasing its dividend for 52 consecutive years. Target's long-term prospects remain bright, with its digital channel enjoying strong growth and investments in technology enabling operational efficiency.\n\nOther dividend stocks to consider include Honda Motor, PepsiCo, United Parcel Service, and Verizon Communications, which offer forward dividend yields ranging from 3.59% to 6.68%.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
