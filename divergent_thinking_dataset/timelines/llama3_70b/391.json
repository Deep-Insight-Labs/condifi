  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

Ives' previous predictions, including a 20% gain in 2023 and a 25% gain in 2024, were accurate. He believes the AI boom will drive a multiyear rally in the stock market, similar to the dot-com boom of the 1990s.\n\nKey drivers of the AI rally include rapid growth in revenue and profit for stocks like Nvidia, as well as the increasing demand for AI components from cloud infrastructure companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon. Ives also notes that the departure of Lina Khan as head of the Federal Trade Commission may lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for big tech companies.\n\nHowever, investors should be cautious due to the high valuations of tech stocks, with the Nasdaq trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 35 and many individual stocks, such as Apple, trading at inflated valuations. A better strategy for investors may be to tactfully invest in the industry, either by waiting for pullbacks in specific stocks or using ETFs to diversify risk.\n[Output in JSON]\n",

The first branch leads to a multiyear rally in the stock market, driven by the growth of AI-related stocks and a favorable regulatory environment. The second branch leads to a significant decline in tech stocks, driven by the bursting of the AI bubble and a subsequent bear market.\n\nThe timeline also highlights the importance of valuation concerns, investor caution, and the use of ETFs to diversify risk. The stabilization of tech stocks and the new normal of moderate growth and valuations are also possible outcomes.\n\nThe plausibility of each path is supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and historical analogs. The novelty of the timeline lies in its creative branching and exploration of counterintuitive paths, such as the AI bubble burst and the subsequent bear market. The elaboration of each node provides specific and refined occurrences, making the timeline a mini-case study. Finally, the timeline is actionable, as it informs specific investment actions and hedging strategies, such as investing in ETFs to diversify risk or waiting for pullbacks in specific stocks.",
