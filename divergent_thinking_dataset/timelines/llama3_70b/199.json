Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

Brent crude has rallied to $80 per barrel, driven by tightening supply dynamics and uncertainty about future Russian oil exports. The US sanctions target two major Russian oil companies responsible for nearly 1 million barrels per day of seaborne exports in 2024, and 183 Russian vessels, accounting for 1.7 million barrels per day of Russian crude and product exports in 2024.\n\nGoldman Sachs commodity analyst estimates that Brent crude could peak at $90 per barrel in March under a worst-case scenario where Russian output drops by 1 million barrels per day and Iranian supply falls persistently by 1 million barrels per day. However, the long-term price impact of lower sanctioned supply is limited as OPEC+ is expected to stabilize the market by deploying its high spare capacity.\n\nThe incoming Trump administration's approach to Russian sanctions is uncertain, and Goldman Sachs suggests that Trump may not lift the measures immediately, potentially tying their removal to the negotiation or implementation of a Ukraine-Russia peace deal. Price-sensitive buyers, such as China, India, and Turkey, have increasingly imported Russian crude since the West imposed sanctions in 2022, and Russian oil can discount to incentivize continued shipping by a dynamic shadow fleet and purchases by price-sensitive buyers in existing or new destinations.\n\nGoldman Sachs outlined four scenarios that could drive Brent oil prices increasingly higher, including a temporary drop in Russian production, persistent drops in Russian supply, a fall in Iranian exports, and a combined disruption of Russian and Iranian supplies. The base case for Russian production assumes an average of 10.6 million barrels per day in 2025.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
