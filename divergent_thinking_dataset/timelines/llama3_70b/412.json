  "prompt": "\nGiven the following scenario, first consider the actors and stakeholders involved then extrapolate and present as a timeline how the situation might evolve. \nConsider as many multiple possibilities based on possible responses which are to be represented as branches on this timeline. \n\nMake sure that the timeline generated are of **HIGH QUALITY** as defined by the following criteria\n* Plausibility: Economic, financial and political plausibility of each path on the timeline \n    * High: Events are strongly supported by current macro data, institutional knowledge, and have strong analogs in history or system models (e.g., “monetary tightening leads to recession, triggering a political backlash”)\n    * Low: Contains major violations of cause-effect logic, timing, or real-world behavior (e.g., hyperinflation causes interest rate cuts during a currency collapse)\n* Novelty: Creativity/originality in the nodes and paths, are they something you may have overlooked?\n    * High: Demonstrates expert-level creative reasoning. Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

These companies are Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, and they are forecast to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. \n\nApple has launched its Apple Intelligence software, which includes AI-powered writing tools and a Siri upgrade. It uses the company's latest chips, designed for processing AI workloads on-device, and has the potential to become the biggest distributor of AI to consumers. Apple has a 7.6% weighting in the S&P 500.\n\nNvidia is the leading supplier of graphics processors (GPUs) for developing AI and has just started shipping its new Blackwell GB200 GPUs, which offer a substantial leap in performance. Demand is significantly outstripping supply, and the company is on track to generate a record $128.6 billion in total revenue during fiscal 2025, followed by almost $200 billion in fiscal 2026. Nvidia has a 6.6% weighting in the S&P 500.\n\nMicrosoft has invested $10 billion in OpenAI and launched its own AI virtual assistant called Copilot, which is now embedded in its flagship software products. It has also launched a portfolio of AI services on its Azure cloud platform. Microsoft has allocated $55.7 billion to capital expenditures during its fiscal 2024 and is on track to invest a record amount in its AI ambitions during the current year. Microsoft has a 6.3% weighting in the S&P 500.\n\nAlphabet has launched its own family of AI models, called Gemini, and a chatbot with the same name. It is using them to change how Google Search responds to queries and has introduced an AI Overviews feature, which incorporates text, images, and links to third-party websites. Alphabet has a 4.1% weighting in the S&P 500.\n\nAmazon is integrating AI into the entire customer experience and has launched a virtual shopping assistant called Rufus. It is also using a tool called Project Private Investigator inside its fulfillment centers to identify defective products before they're shipped out. Amazon has allocated around $75 billion to AI capital expenditures during 2024 and is likely to spend even more in 2025 to cement its leadership position. Amazon has a 4.1% weighting in the S&P 500.\n\nThe five companies have delivered an average gain of 61% in the past year, and their efforts in the AI space are expected to continue driving growth.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
