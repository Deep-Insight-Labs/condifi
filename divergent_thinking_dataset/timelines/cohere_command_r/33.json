Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The company owns many cigarette brands, including Marlboro, and sells them in virtually every country except China and the US. \n\nPhilip Morris International's legacy tobacco profits are expected to be durable and grow in the years to come due to price increases on packs of cigarettes. However, the company is not sitting tight and has spent billions of dollars and made a large acquisition to tackle the new-age nicotine market. It has the leading heat-not-burn device, IQOS, and owns Zyn, the dominant nicotine pouch brand in the US.\n\nThe company's smoke-free revenue grew 16.8% year over year last quarter on the back of volume growth from IQOS and Zyn. Smoke-free categories now account for 38% of the company's overall revenue and will become a growing piece of the pie for years to come. \n\nPhilip Morris International's revenue grew 11% year over year last quarter, and once the Zyn shortage ends, this should lead to an acceleration of Zyn's volume growth and the company's topline revenue growth. The combination of Zyn and IQOS volume growth has the potential to drive double-digit revenue and earnings growth for many years into the future.\n\nThe company's dividend per share is currently $5.25, which is sustainably funded with its $6.46 in free cash flow per share. Over the coming years, the company's free cash flow per share is expected to climb higher due to growth factors, providing room to raise the dividend per share and increase income from the investment each year.\n\nPhilip Morris International is a rock-solid pick during this one-time transition from cigarettes to safer nicotine products, with a starting dividend yield of 4.2% and a dominant position in nicotine pouches and heat-not-burn devices.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
