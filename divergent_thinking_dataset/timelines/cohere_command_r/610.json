Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

This improvement is attributed to efficiency gains in engine fuel burn, with the majority of the reduction coming from engine advancements. New projects on the horizon, such as the CFM RISE and the Rolls-Royce UltraFan, are poised to revolutionize the industry.\n\nThe CFM RISE, a joint venture between GE Aerospace and Safran, aims to be 20% more fuel efficient with 20% less carbon emissions compared to CFM's current Leap engine. The engine features an open fan architecture, with a single rotating fan and variable-pitch carbon fibre blades. The RISE technology is being developed to be fuel-source agnostic, compatible with alternative energy sources such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hydrogen.\n\nThe Rolls-Royce UltraFan, a cutting-edge turbofan engine, promises a 10% efficiency improvement over its predecessor, the Trent XWB. The engine utilizes a geared architecture, allowing for a larger and more efficient fan, spinning at a slower rate. The UltraFan will have the largest bypass ratio of any engine used today on commercial jet aircraft, with a 25% fuel burn improvement, 40% reduction in NOx emissions, and 35% reduction in noise compared to previous models.\n\nBoth engines face significant challenges, including complexity, integration, and competition. However, they are expected to shape and inspire the next generation of engine technology, paving the way for a green aviation future. Sustainability and efficiency will remain the focus of engine development in the future, with trends including efficiency improvements, electric and hybrid propulsion, and sustainable aviation fuels.\n\nGE Aerospace, a leading engine manufacturer, is a key player in the development of these innovative engines. The company has a century of experience and powerful passion for providing aviation insurance solutions that protect industry stakeholders and empower the industry to thrive.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
