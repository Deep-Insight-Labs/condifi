Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., “trade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital”). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., “Volkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices”). Truly investment-grade thinking.\n    * Low: Nodes are generic (e.g., “market reacts”, “tensions rise”) with no detail on mechanisms, actors, or consequences. Lacks causal clarity.\n* Actionable: Can this timeline inform specific investment actions or hedging strategies?\n    * High: Timeline includes sector impacts, asset class consequences, or opportunities (e.g., “short EU auto suppliers”, “long U.S. rail freight”)\n    * Low: Insightful narrative, but no clear link to tradable instruments or positioning ideas\n\nKeep to the output format below where ascii is used to represent the timeline as a tree. \n\n[Example of Scenario]\nWASHINGTON/DETROIT, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of orders to soften the blow of his auto tariffs on Tuesday with a mix of credits and relief from other levies on materials, and his trade team touted its first deal with a foreign trading partner.\nThe developments helped eased some investor worries about the erratic trade policies of Trump as the president visited Michigan, a cradle of the U.S. auto industry, just days before a fresh set of 25% import taxes was set to kick in on automotive components.\n\n[Example of Output]\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial Event\",\n  \"description\": \"German inflation data released at 2.2%\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance\",\n      \"date_range\": \"May\",\n      \"description\": \"ECB maintains dovish stance, keeps rates low\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.1\",\n          \"title\": \"German banks increase lending\",\n          \"description\": \"German banks benefit from low rates, increase lending\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.2\",\n          \"title\": \"Euro weakens\",\n          \"description\": \"Euro weakens, boosting exports\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.3\",\n          \"title\": \"Moderate industrial growth\",\n          \"description\": \"German industry reports moderate growth\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"T1A1.4\",\n          \"title\": \"Bundesbank caution\",\n          \"description\": \"Bundesbank signals caution on inflation\",\n          \"children\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": \"T2A1\",\n              \"title\": \"Industry adapts to inflation\",\n              \"date_range\": \"June–August\",\n              \"description\": \"Companies pass on higher costs;

The major averages posted back-to-back weekly losses, with the falling 1.9% and the tech-heavy declining 2.3%. The 30-stock gave up 1.9% on the week.\n\nThe week ahead is expected to be eventful, with key economic data including U.S. consumer price inflation report for December, producer prices, and December retail sales. The fourth quarter earnings season is also set to get underway, with major banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and BlackRock due to report.\n\nGoldman Sachs is expected to outperform this week, with its Q4 earnings report likely to surpass expectations. The investment banking giant is benefiting from a rebound in IPO activity, mergers, and global deal-making, alongside steady growth in its wealth management division. Analysts expect Goldman to earn $8.28 per share in the final three months of 2024, surging 51.1% from EPS of $5.48 in the year-ago period. Revenue is anticipated to rise 10% year-over-year to $12.4 billion.\n\nGoldman Sachs stock ended Friday's session at $560, with a market cap of $184.4 billion. Shares are down 2.2% so far in 2025 after scoring an annual gain of 48.4% in 2024. According to AI-powered Fair Value models, GS stock appears to be extremely undervalued, with potential upside of +15.8% from the current market value to about $649/share.\n\nCitigroup, on the other hand, faces a challenging outlook due to near-term headwinds, making it less compelling in the current environment. The megabank's Q4 update is due ahead of the opening bell on Wednesday, with results likely to take a hit from a slowdown in its consumer banking division. Analysts expect Citi to earn $1.24 per share on revenue of $19.51 billion, but lingering macroeconomic challenges and deposit stability concerns weigh heavily on its prospects.\n[Output in JSON]\n",
