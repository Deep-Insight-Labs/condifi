Identifies counterintuitive paths, rare risks, or hidden feedback loops. May challenge conventional wisdom in a grounded way (e.g., \u201ctrade war accelerates global realignment of semiconductors via Middle East sovereign wealth capital\u201d). Could lead to edge in investment or policy thinking.\n    * Low: Timeline is linear, obvious, or closely tracks past headlines or boilerplate analysis. No creative branching or exploration.\n* Elaboration: How specific and refined are the occurrences represented by the nodes?\n    * High: Timeline reads like a mini-case study. Each node could stand alone as an actionable insight. Paths show feedback loops, strategic responses, and sector-level granularity (e.g., \u201cVolkswagen reallocates $1.2B R&D from EVs to hybrid tech in response to rare earth prices\u201d).

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this scenario. The user wants a high-quality timeline based on the given scenario involving U.S. stocks, Nvidia, Lowe's, and the upcoming economic data. The key is to ensure plausibility, novelty, elaboration, and actionable insights.\n\nFirst, the main actors and stakeholders here are the Federal Reserve (with their speakers), investors reacting to economic data, Nvidia and Lowe's as companies, and the broader market participants. The Fed's communication and the core PCE data will influence market expectations on interest rates. Nvidia's earnings could impact tech stocks and AI sector sentiment, while Lowe's struggles might reflect broader consumer trends.\n\nStarting with the initial event: U.S. stocks' worst week in 2025. The immediate next step is the release of core PCE and Fed speakers. The core PCE is a key inflation metric. If it comes in higher than expected, the Fed might signal a more hawkish stance, leading to market volatility. Conversely, if it's lower, they might be more dovish. \n\nFor Nvidia, strong earnings could boost the tech sector, but any miss or cautious guidance might trigger a sell-off. Their dominance in AI chips is crucial, so supply chain issues or regulatory actions could be branches. For Lowe's, poor performance might indicate a weak housing market or consumer spending slowdown, affecting retail and related sectors.\n\nConsidering plausible branches: The Fed's reaction to inflation data could lead to either rate hikes or a pause. Nvidia's earnings could affect semiconductor stocks, AI investments, or even geopolitical factors like export controls. Lowe's issues might point to a housing market downturn, impacting home improvement retailers and suppliers.\n\nNovelty is important. Maybe Nvidia's success accelerates AI adoption in unexpected sectors, or their supply chain issues lead to new partnerships. For Lowe's, a merger or shift to e-commerce could be a path. The Fed's communication might inadvertently cause a liquidity crunch in emerging markets, affecting global trade.\n\nElaboration requires specific nodes. For example, if the Fed tightens, how exactly do markets react? Maybe tech valuations compress, leading to sector rotation. If Lowe's partners with a tech company for AR shopping, that's a specific action with supply chain implications.\n\nActionable insights: Shorting home improvement suppliers if Lowe's falters, going long on AI infrastructure stocks if Nvidia excels, or investing in emerging market bonds if the Fed's policies lead to capital outflows.\n\nPutting this all together into a timeline with branches. Start with the initial event, then split based on PCE data and Fed response. Each of those branches leads to market reactions, then company-specific outcomes, and further economic or political developments. Each node should have specific, detailed consequences and possible investment actions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"U.S. Equity Selloff & Macro Catalysts\",\n  \"description\": \"S&P 500 drops 1.7%, Nasdaq 2.5% ahead of critical PCE data, Fed speeches, and NVDA/LOW earnings\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"Hot PCE Print (3.1% YoY)\",\n      \"date_range\": \"Next 3 Sessions\",\n      \"description\": \"Core PCE exceeds consensus (2.9%), validating sticky services inflation.
