  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this scenario step by step. The user wants a high-quality analysis of Tesla's stock situation with a timeline that branches based on possible responses. The criteria are plausibility, novelty, elaboration, and actionable insights.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key factors in the scenario: declining demand in China due to new regulations favoring domestic manufacturers, increased production costs from supply chain issues and raw material prices, regulatory scrutiny on Autopilot, and overall market trends affecting the S&P 500. The financials show revenue growth but declining net income and cash reserves.\n\nStarting with the initial event: Tesla's stock decline. The main stakeholders here include Tesla management, Chinese regulators, domestic EV manufacturers in China, suppliers, competitors like BYD, NIO, and investors.\n\nNext, possible immediate responses. Tesla could cut prices to boost demand, which might lead to a price war. Alternatively, they might lobby the Chinese government for exemptions. Another path is accelerating cost-cutting measures, like vertical integration or renegotiating supplier contracts. Each of these has different consequences.\n\nIf Tesla cuts prices (T1A1), Chinese competitors might respond with their own cuts, leading to a price war. This could erode margins further but might help Tesla maintain market share. However, if they lobby successfully (T1A2), they might get temporary exemptions, allowing them to stabilize sales. On the cost-cutting side (T1A3), vertical integration could reduce dependency on suppliers but require upfront investment.\n\nLooking at the next branches. For T1A1.1 (price war), BYD and NIO cutting prices would pressure margins. Tesla might have to accelerate production of the Model 2, a cheaper model, which could tap into a new market segment but strain cash reserves. If cash reserves drop below $15B (T2A1.1), they might need to raise capital, diluting shares. Alternatively, if Model 2 succeeds (T2A1.2), they could gain market share in emerging markets.\n\nFor the lobbying path (T1A2), if exemptions are granted, Tesla could stabilize sales but face political backlash in the US, leading to scrutiny. This might result in domestic manufacturing incentives (T2A2.1), which could improve margins but require capital expenditure. If exemptions are denied (T1A2.2), Tesla might pivot to other markets like India, but face challenges there.\n\nCost-cutting measures (T1A3) leading to vertical integration (T1A3.1) could reduce costs but might face delays. If successful, margins improve; if not, production halts. Supplier consolidation (T1A3.2) could lead to partnerships but also risks if suppliers can't meet demands.\n\nLonger-term implications: A price war might lead to industry consolidation (T3A1), benefiting Tesla if they survive. Regulatory battles could lead to global safety standards (T3A2), affecting Autopilot's rollout. Successful cost-cutting might make Tesla a low-cost leader (T3A3), affecting competitors.\n\nActionable insights: Short Chinese EV suppliers if price war continues, long on lithium miners if Tesla secures supply, short legacy automakers if Tesla becomes a cost leader, etc.\n\nNeed to ensure each node is specific, plausible, and offers investment angles. Check for historical analogs, like past price wars in automotive, regulatory exemptions similar to other industries, and vertical integration examples. Also, consider feedback loops, like how price cuts affect competitors' responses, which in turn impact Tesla's strategy again.\n\nMake sure the branches explore both positive and negative outcomes, and that each node has enough detail to stand alone. Avoid generic terms; instead, mention specific companies, models, and financial thresholds. This should create a comprehensive, investment-grade timeline with multiple plausible pathways.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"T0\",\n  \"title\": \"Tesla Q1 2025 Weakness: China Demand Shock + Cost Pressures\",\n  \"description\": \"TSLA opens 2025 down 1.93% Y/Y due to: 1) China EV demand slump (domestic subsidy shift), 2) 20% net income decline despite 10% revenue growth, 3) Autopilot regulatory risks, 4) S&P 500 correlation drag\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"T1A1\",\n      \"title\": \"Tesla Slashes China Prices 15% to Defend Share\",\n      \"date_range\": \"Feb-Mar 2025\",\n      \"description\": \"Aggressive price cuts on Model 3/Y to counter BYD/NIO subsidy advantage.
